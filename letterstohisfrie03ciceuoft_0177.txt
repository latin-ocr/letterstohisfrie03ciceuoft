CICERO TO P. SlLlUS, PHOPRAETOR·

Cilicia, probably late in 51 ac.

Ι blessed you for what you did in the business of
Atilius ὸ (for though Ι came late, I was yet able,
thanks to your kindness, to save an honourable
Roman knight), and as a matter of fact I have always
taken it for granted that I had you “ in my pocket‚’' '⁰
since our friend Lamiad had bound us together in
so peculiarly close an association. So in the firstplace
I thank you for freeing me from all awkwa-rdness, and
then Ι go further in shamelessness (but I shall make
it good ‘³3 for I shall always honour and uphold ‚you
more conscientiously than anybody). It is about my
brother Quintus3 if you have any regard for me,
see that you put him in the same categoqry of regard
as you do myself. So will you enhance your already
great kindness by a great. and crowning addition.
