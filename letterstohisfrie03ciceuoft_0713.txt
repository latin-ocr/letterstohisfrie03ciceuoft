EPISTULAE AD BRL'TUM, xvu.

Philippus‚⁰ seeing that he has given away less to his
stepson than Cicero gives away to a stranger. So
let him cease positively to pursue us with his boastings
and inflame our sores ! For what advantage is it to
us that Antony has suffered defeat, if his defeat
merely serves to put the place which he held at
another’s disposal ?

And yet your letter implies a doubt even now. 6
Very well then ! Let Cicero live on as a suppliant and
an underling, since he is capable of such things, if

able to give you something of my views. Ι am not
surprised that Porcia’s ⁶ health is causing you anxiety.
Finally, I shall be glad to do what you ask me, for
