EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 1.

too little consideration for your good name—men who
might very likely have taken you in, when you werc a
mere novice, generous soul that you are (for the
better a man is, the more difficult it is for him to sus·
pect others of being unscrupulous), but, as it is, let
the third year show the same standard of integrity
as the preceding two, but even an increase in caution
and in diligence.

Let your ears be such as are reputed to hear only 13
what they do hear, and not such as are open to false
and interested whispers prompted by the hope of
profit. Let not your signet-ring be a sort of utensil,
but, as, it were, your very sels—not the servant of
another's will, but the witness of your own. Let your
beadle a hold the rank which he was intended to hold
by our ancestors, who, regarding that post not as a
lucrative sinecure but as one of work and duty, were
slow to confer it upon any but their own freedmen,
over whom they exercised much the same authority
as over their slaves.b Let your lictor be the dis-
penser not of his own, but of your clemency,⁰ and let
the fasces and axes they carry before them be more
the symbols of rank than of power. In a word, let it
be recognized by the whole province that the welfare,
children, reputation‚ and fortunes of all whom you
govern are most precious to you. Finally, let it be
the general impression that you will regard with dis-
favour not only those who have taken a bribe, but
also those who have given one, if ever you get to
know of it. And, as a matter of fact, there will be no
giving of bribes when it is made perfectly clear that,
as a rule, nothing is got out of you through the
machinations of persons pretending to have great
influence with you.
