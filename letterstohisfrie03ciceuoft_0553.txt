EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, II. xu.

on the Ich, after Appius had got together a sparsely
attended Senate, the procecdings were so frosty, that
he was forced by our whimperings ‘² to dismiss us.
As to the Commagenian‚b because I had exploded 2

the whole affair, it is amazing how Appius fawns upon
me, both personally and through Pomponius 3 for he
sees that if I adopt the same style of speaking in all
the other cases, February will be a barren month for
him. And I made fun of Antiochus in quite a merry
way, and not only made him take his hands off that
tiny town situated in the territory of Zeugma on the
Euphrates‚⁰ but I moreover excited much general
laughter by jeering at the fellow’s toga praeteria
which he had obtained in the consulship of Caesar.
‘¹ As to his wishing us (Ι said) to renew those same 3
honours, it is my opinion that no decree at all is
needed to forbid his furbishing up his toga praeteria
every year. But will you, my noble friends, who
did not tolerate the wearing of the toga praetexta by
the Bostran, tolerate it in the case of this Com-
magenian ? ’' ἀ You see the style Ι adopted, and the
opportunity I had for a bit of fun. I spoke a lot in
condemnation of his scurvy majesty, with the result
that he was hissed off the stage neck-and-crop. But
that same style of mine greatly agitated AppiuS, and
he embraces me like a mother. The rest of his pro-
posals it is the easiest thing in the world to scatter
to the winds. But I am not going so far as to offend
him, for fear he implores the protection of Jupiter

texta as often as he pleases, butas for his wearing it in public
you will not allow him to do so any niorc than 3ou all »w ed
the Bos tran to do so. ’⁹ Bostra (the Boziah of Isaiah) was

in Arabia Petraea. lhe reference is to some unknown
tetrarch of that district.
