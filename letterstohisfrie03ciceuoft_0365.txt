We left, as you are aware, on November and. We l
arrived at Leucas on November 6111, 31 Actium on the
7th. There, on account of 1116 weather, we staved

cyra until November l5th‚ being held up by storms.
On November 16111 we proceeded 120 stades to

were held up by contrary winds right up to the ι221111.
Meanwhile those who impatiently put to sea, and
