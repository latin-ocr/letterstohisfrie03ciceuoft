EPISTULAE AD samum, xx.
XX (Ι. 7)

BRUTUS ΤΟ CICERO
In camp, about June 22, 43 B.0.

You have been such a stout champion of the state, 1
and have shown such anxious care for it, that no one
can appraise better than you how fond I ought to be
of L. Bibulus.⁰ In view of this, either consideration
ought to win your interest in him, his own merits or
my intimacy with him. That is all the more reason,
I think, for my not w riting at length3 for my wish
ought to carry weight with you, granted that it is
reasonable, and that I am seeking to realize it as in
duty bound to oblige a friend. He has decided to
sue for Pansa’ s place δ’ ; we beg you to nominate him
for it. You could not bestow a favour on a closer
friend than I am to you, nor nominate a more worthy
candidate than Bibulus.

As for Domitius ⁶ and Apuleius,‘²l what concern of 2
mine is it to write, since they stand high in your
favour by virtue of their own personalities ? Apuleius,
you know, has a claim to be supported by your influ-
ence. But Apuleius will receive a testimonial in his
own letter. Do not deprive Bibulus of your fostering
care : he is already a man of such calibre that,
believe me, he may in the course of his development
rise equal to the eulogies of your elite.
