EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. xv.

For who would imagine that the war would be pro-
tracted or cause so long a delay as 11131 caused by thc
Alexandrian war‚⁰ or that this Pharnaces? whoever 116
may be, would intimidate Asia ?

You and I‚however,though our policy was identical‚ 3
have found 3 difference in our fortunes ; for while you
took a line which enabled you to share his 6011115615. and
50 being able to foresee (and that is a potent allevia·
tion of anxiety) what was going to happen, I, who
hastened to meet Caesar in Italy (for that is what
Ι supposed) and “ to spur the willing horse‚'' as the
adage has it, when, after sparing so many of our most
distinguished men, he was actually returning to the
ways of peace, I on the contrary, both am and have
been kept utterly apart from him. I spend my life,
moreover, amid the groans of Italy, and the piteous
lamentations of the city; and we might perhaps have
done something to alleviate them, I in my way, you
in yours, everybody in his own, if only the man in
authority had been there.

I should like you‚therefore‚consistently with your 4
unfailing kindness to me, to write and tell me what
your impressions and your feelings are, what you
think we should wait for, and what you think we
should do. I shall greatly value a letter from you ;
and how I wish I had followed the advice contained
in that first letter ⁰ you sent me from Luceria! l
should then have retained my position without any
friction at all. Farewell.
