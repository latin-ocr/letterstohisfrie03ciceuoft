EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XVI. xan—xxnz

that Ι would have you forget the payment of your

I am expecting Lepta ⁰ and Ν fl too—and Ι shall have
to avail myself of the sweetness of your conversa-

Arpinum, middle of November, 44 B.c.

Although I had sent. Harpalus earlier in the day, 1
still, finding that I had a trustworthy letter-carrier,
although there is nothing new, I wanted to write to
you again and again on the same subjects—not that
I have lost confidenee in your application‚ but the
importanee of the matter makes me restless. The
“stem and stern ”f (as the Greek proverb goes) of
my sending you away from me was that you might
straighten out my finaneial affairs. It is imperative
that Ofillius 9 and Aurelius ἢ should have their
claims satisfied. I should like you to wring out of
Flamma, if not all the debt, at least some portion
it ; and especially to see that the instalmenti is cleared
off on January lst. As to the assignment of debts,
make some settlement3 and please see to their
paying ready money. So much for my private
affairs.

⁰ A co-heir with Cicero to the estate of Cluvius of Puteoli.

'¹ An agent of one Montanus, who had become surety to
Plancus for Flaminius Flamma, and was now obliged to
meet Flamma's liabilities.

⁶ i.e., of Tullia's dowry by Dolabella.
