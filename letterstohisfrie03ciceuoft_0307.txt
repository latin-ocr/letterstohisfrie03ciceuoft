EPlS'l'ULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. ως.

IX

elcssno To MARCUS MARCELLUS,‘¹ costL

Between Iconium and Cybistra, early in September, 51 Β.(·.

Ι am highly delighted that by the electiori of Gaius 1
Marcellus to the consulship you have gathered the
fruit: of your affection for your family, of your devotion
to the commonwealth, and of your own most illus-
trious and admirable consulship. I have no doubt as
to the sentiments of those on the spot, when I myself,
far away as I am, and despatched by yourself to the
ends of the earth, am extolling you, I vow, up to
the skies, and my praises are as sincere as they are
well deserved. For while I have had a particular
affection for you from my boyhood, and you have ever
desired, and indeed deemed me to possess the widest
influence in every direction, my affection for you has
been greatly deepened and enhanced by this achieve-
ment of yours, or shall I call it this pronouncement of
the Roman people in your favour ? And I feel a thrill
of pure delight when I am told by people of un-
common shrewdness and men of the highest character
that in every word and deed, pursuit and principle, I
am like you, or you are like me (whichever you prefer).

If, however, you add to the brilliant achievements 2
of your consulship by contriving either that somebody
may succeed me at the earliest possible date, or that
no addition is made to the time you definitely fixed for
me both by a decree of the Senate and by the lamb—-
well, then I shall consider that there is nothing you
have not enabled me to secure. T ake care of your
health, and show your regard for me and defend me
in my absence.
