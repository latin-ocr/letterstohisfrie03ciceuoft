EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. 11.

CICERO TO QUINTUS
Rome, October 11, 54 mc.

On October 10 in the evening, Salvius took ship l
and started for Ostia, taking the things you wanted
sent to you from home. On the same day Mem-
mius ‘² gave Gabinius such a blazing hot time of it
before the people, that Calidius b hadn't a chance of
saying a word for him. To-morrow (that is the day
after to-morrow‚ since I am writing before daybreak)
there is to be a trial ⁰ before Cato to decide who is to
conduct his prosecution, among Memmius, Tiberius
Ner0, and C. and L. Antonius, the sons of Marcus.
I think it likely that Memmius will be appointed,
though Nero is making a wonderful effort. In short,
Gabinius is in a very tight corner, unless our friend
Pompey, to the disgust of gods and men, contrives
to upset the apple-cart.d

Now mark the fellow's impudence, and find 2
something to amuse you amid the ruins of the
Republic. Gabinius, having declared wherever he
came, that he was demanding a triumph, and hav-
ing suddenly changed his plans, and—consummate
commander that he is—entered the city (he knew
it was his enemies' city) by night, did not, how-
ever, trust himself to enter the Senate. Meantime,
exactly on the tenth day, on which it was his duty in
person to report the number of the slain among the
enemy and his own men,⁶ he crept into the Senate
when it was very thinly attended. When he wished

sustained by the Romans and the enemy in any actions
fought during the governorships.
