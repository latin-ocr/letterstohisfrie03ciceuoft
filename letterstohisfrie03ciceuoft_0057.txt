Rome, about the middle of 56 1³.c.

M. T. Cicero warmly greets Q. Valerius Orca, Son
of Quintus, Proconsul.

If you are well, 311 15 right 3 I am well. I believe l
it is within your recollection that I said something
to you in the plesence of P. Cuspius& as I was
escorting you when in your official uniform‚⁰ and
that afterualds also Ι ple ided with you at greater
length, to reckon amono my own connexions any
whom Ι might recommend to you as being hiS. That,
consistently with your sincere affection O'fm me and
the respect you hare inx 1·riably shown me, you ver)
handSomely and 601111601151)γ unde1 took to do forme.

Now Cuspius, 3 man most ready to help all those 2
associated with him, shows an amazingly benevolent
interest in certain persons within your province,
because he has twice been in Africa, presiding over
the hiohly important negotiations of his society
And so I arn in the habit of supporting, with such
1650111665 and influence as I 6311. 11115 leadiness to
help which he displays towards them. I therefore
thought it incumbent upon me to explain to you in
this letter the reason why I rccommend all the friends
of Cuspius. In future letters Ι shall do no more
than append the mark agreed upon between you
and me, and indicate at the same time that it is one
of Cuspius’s friends.d

But 35 for the recommendation I have been willing 3
to sign in this letter, Ι would have you know that it is
more important than any ; for Cuspius 1135 urged me
