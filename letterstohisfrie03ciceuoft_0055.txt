EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. v.

I have been on very intimate terms with C. 2
Curtiusa from the days of our youth. Not only didI
resent his most unjust degradation in Sulla’s time,
but when it appeared that those who had suffered
similar wrong, though they had lost all their fortunes,
were yet permitted by universal consent to return to
their country, Ι have assisted in his rehabilitation.

Now Curtius has a holding in the territory of
Volaterrae into which, just as though he had been
shipwrecked, he had collected all that was left to
him. But just at this moment Caesar has chosen
him to be a member of the Senate—a rank, which, if
he 10565 that holding of his, 116 cannot easily main-
tain. Now it is very hard upon him that, though he
has been raised higher as regards rank, he should be
in a lower position as regards means3 and it is
shockingly inconsistent that the very man who is a
senator by Caesar’s favour should be ejected from
land that is being distributed by Caesar's order.

But I am less inclined to write at any length on the 3
equity of the case, for fear it should be thought that
what strengthened my hands in pleading with you
was not so much my personal influence 35 the justice
of my plea. I therefore beg you, with more than
usual urgency, to regard C. Curtius's affair as my
own ; and in whatever you do for my sake, although
you may have done it for C. Curtius’s sake, to believe
that any favour 116 obtains through me is 3 favour
conferred upon me by yourself. This I beg of you
again and again in all earnestness to do.
