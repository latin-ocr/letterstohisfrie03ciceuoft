CICERO TO TERENTIA AND TULLIA

Off Formiae, June mh, 49 Β.ο.

All the troubles and anxieties, with which I kept l
both you in a state of utter misery (which troubles
me more than anything) and dear Tullia too, who is
sweeter to us both than our very lives—all those, I
say, I have put away and got rid of. What the
reason was Ι discovered the day after I left you ; it
was undiluted bile 3 Ι got rid of it all that night. My
immediate relief was such that I fancied some god or
other had doctored me, and to that god I beg you to
pay due tribute with piety and purity as you always
do——I mean to Apollo and Aesculapius.‘¹

I am confident that we have a right good ship ; Ι 2
wrote this as soon as I had got on board. Later on
I shall write a number of letters to our friends, and
commend you and our darling Tullia to their care
with all the warmth in the world. I should exhort
you both to show a more courageous spirit, had I not
discovered that you have more courage than any
man of us all. Yet, after all, I trust that affairs are
such that I may hope not only that you two will be
extremely comfortable where you are, but also that
one day I shall have men like myself at my side to
defend the Republic.

As for yourself, I would have you, first of all, take 3
care of your health ; in the next place, ifit so please
you, you will make use of those villas which will be
farthest away from men-in-arms. You can con-
veniently occupy the farm at Arpinum with our town
staff of servants, if the price of provisions has risenfl
