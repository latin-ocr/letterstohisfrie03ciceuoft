EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. xva.

prospect have I of a moment's leisure, especially if
Ι stay, as he asks me to, in Rome ? But I shall bear
it in mind. Very likely, as usual, my love for you will
surmount all difficulties.

For having sent him Trebatius he expresses his 3
gratitude to me very wittily and courteously too. He
declares that in all that crowd who were on his staff
there was not a single man who could draw up so
much as a form of recognizance. I applied to him for
a tribuneship for M. Curtiusa (as for Domitius,b he
would have suspected me of making fun of him had
I asked him for it ; indecd his daily joke is that he
has not even the appointment of a military tribune 3
even in the Senate he twitted his colleague Appius
with having gone to Caesar for the sole purpose of
getting a tribuneship out of him), but for next year 3
and that is just what Curtius wanted.

As to what you think my behaviour should be in 4
politics and in dealing with my enemies‚ Ι would have
you know that I am, and always will be, “ softer than
the lobe of your ear.'’ ⁰

The position of affairs in Rome is as follows : there 5
is some hope of the elections being held, but it is a
vague one ς there is also some suspicion of a dictator-
ship, but even that has no certain foundation ; the
forum is profoundly tranquil, but that indicates senile
decay, rather than acquiescence, on the part of the
State, while the opinions I express in the Senate are
such that others agree with them more than I do
myself. “ Such is the havoc wrouglzt by wretched war.’' d

proverb. For orricilla=auricilla ‘'f- plostrum :plauserunt
Polla = Paulla and Clodius = Claudius.
