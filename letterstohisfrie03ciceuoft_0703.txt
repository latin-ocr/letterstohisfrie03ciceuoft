EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xv.—XVI.
xv (1. 8)

CICERO To BRUTUS
Rome, end of May or early June, 43 ac.

I shall recommend large numbers of men to you, 1
and recommend them I must needs. For all the
worthiest men and citizens pay the highest regard to
your judgement, and all stout—hearted men want
to work heart and soul for you, and there is none but
holds the view that my claim to your deference and
gratitude carry great weight with you.

But C. Nasenm'us, from the borough of Suessa, I 2
recommend to you with special earnestness. In the
Cretan warf' under the command of Metellus& he was
first centurion of the eighth cohort. In the years
to follow he attended to his family affairs. At
the present time, under the compelling influence of
party loyalty and of your pre-eminent high rank,
he wants to obtain through you some position of
authority. I recommend him to you, Brutus, as a
gallant man, a man of distinction and, if this is
relevant to the case, of ample means. Ι shall be
deeply obliged, if you give him such treatment that
he may be able to thank me on the strength of your
good deed.
