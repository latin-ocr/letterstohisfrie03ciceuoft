EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. 11.

the part of king by first of all ensuring the preserva-
tion of his own life 3 to exercise his royal rights upon
those by whom he was now convinced that the plot
against him had been concocted3 to punish those
whom it was essential to punish, and relieve the fears
of the rest 3 to take advantage ofthe protection of my
army to intimidate those who were to blame rather
than to foster strife3 assuring him at the same time
that all his subjects, on ascertaining the decree of
the Senate, would understand that according to your
resolution I should be there, if the need arose, to pro-
tect the king.

Having encouraged him so far, I struck camp from 8
there, and began my march into Cilicia, leaving
Cappadocia with this impression upon my mind, that
thanks to your policy, by a wonderful and almost pro-
vidential accident, a king upon whom you had
spontaneously and in the most complimentary manner
conferred that title, a king whom you had entrusted to
my protection, a king whose personal safety you had
declared by your decree to be a source of serious
anxiety to yourselves, has been delivered from an
imminent conspiracy by my arrival on the scene.
This much Ι thought it not irrelevant for me to
write to you, so that you might gather from what
has nearly happened that you had provided long
before against its happening 3 and Ι have all the more
pleasure in informing you, because I believe I have
discerned in King Ariobarzanes such evidence of
moral worth, capacity, good saith and friendly feeling
for you, as to make it seem that you have good reason
for having bestowed so much care and attention upon
his welfare.
