decide what Ι must do. All Ι should like you to do
is to write me a full and particular account of all that
happens ; though indeed Ι ought now to be awaiting
some definite aetion rather than a letter. Mind you
keep well and assure yourself that nothing is, or ever
has been, dearer to me than are you. Good-bye
Terentia mine! I seem to see your very face, and

so Ι break down and weep. Good-bye l Nov. 29th.

CICERO TO TERENTIA AND HIS FAMILY
Brundisium, April emh, 58 8.c.

Yes, I do send you a letter less osten than I might, l
because, while every hour of my lise is a misery to
me, yet, when I either write to you, or read a letter
from any of you, I am so overeome with weeping
that I cannot bear it. Would that I had been less
eager to live! At any rate I should have seen no
sorrow, or not much of it, in my life. But if fortune
has in reserve for me any hope at all of getting back
any benefit at any time, the mistake I made is not
so serious3 if, however, these ills can never be re-
moved, I assure you, my dearest, that my desire is
to see you as soon as possible and die in your arms,
since neither the gods, whom you have so virtuously
worshipped, nor the men, whom Ι have ever served,
have shown us any gratitude.

I have been for thirteen days at Brundisium, at 2
the house of M. Laenius Flaccus,‘² an excellent man,
who has shown no thought for his fortunes and civil

that there should be two men of that name in the East at
the same time.
