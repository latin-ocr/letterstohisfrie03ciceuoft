EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. xiv.

CICERO TO QUINTUS IN GAUL

Cumae or Pompeii, middle of May, 54 B.c.

I have so far received two letters from you, onel
of them at the very moment of my departure, the
other posted at Ariminum ; the additional letters you
write that you have sent me Ι have not received. Ι am
enjoying myself quite comfortably‚ except that you
are not with me, at my Cuman and Pompeian resid-
ences, and I intend being in these same spots till
lune 1. Ι am engaged upon the treatise I told you
ibout on the RepubliC—-a very stiff and toilsome
piece of work3 but if it succeeds to my satisfaction‚
the labour will have been well laid out· ‚ if not, I
shall hurl it down into that very sea I am gazing upon
as I write. I shall apply myself to something else,
since inactixity is more than I can stand.

I shall carry out 3our instructions to the letter, 2
both as regards conciliating certain people, and not
estranging certain others. My chief anxiety, 11011-
ever, 11111 ebe to see y·ou1 Cicero (he belongs to both
of us), if Ι may, every day, but I shall test his progress
as often as possible, and, unless he disdains me, Ι shall
even offer him my services as a teacher—-a capacity
in which I have acquired some amount of experience
during these days of leisure in bringing on my own,
I mean the younger, Cicero.

You will, of course, do as you write you will (and 3
even if you did not put it down on paper, I am none
the less assured that you are most conscientious in
doing so), I mean that you will arrange, follow out,
