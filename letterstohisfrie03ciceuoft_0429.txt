EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, Ι. 1.

temptations with which that province of yours
abounds—to deviate from the path of strict integrity
and sobriety of conduct.

But what can one find so excellent or so desirable 9
as that your virtue, your restraint of passion, and
your sels-control, should not lurk in the shadows or be
hidden out of sight, but set in the light of Asia, before
the eyes of a most distinguished province, to ring in
the ears of all the nations and tribes of the earth?
That men are not trampled underfoot in your pro-
gresses, not drained by expenditure, not struck with
panic at your approach ? That, wheresoever you
come, there is an ecstasy of joy, both in public and in
private, since it would seem that the city has taken
unto herself no tyrant, but a guardian, the home no
plunderer, but a guest ?

III. In these matters, however, experience itself lO
has by this time taught you that it is by no means
sufficient to possess these virtues yourself, but that
you must keep diligent watch around you so that in
this guardianship of your province it may appear that
you are responsible to the allies, the citizens, and the
State, not for yourself alone, but for all the officials
of your government. And yet you have as legati men
who are likely to consider their reputation on their
own account ; and of them, in rank, position, and age.
Tubero ⁰ stands first ; and Ι imagine, especially as he
writes history, that he can select many characters
from his own annals whom he would wish and be
able to emulate. Allienusb moreover is our good
friend in spirit and friendly feeling as well as in his
adaptation of himself to our rules of life. About

⁶ A. Allienus, praetor in 49, and proconsul in Sicily in 46.
Fam. xiii. 78 and 79 are addressed to him.
