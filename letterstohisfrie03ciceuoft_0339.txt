Consequently Pansa, who follows “ pleasure,” keeps 3
his hold on virtue, and those also whom you call
‘⁴ pleasure-lovers '' are “ lovers of what is good ” and
‘⁴ lovers qujustice‚’'and cultivate and keep all the virtues.
And so Sulla, whose judgment we ought to accept,
when he saw that the philosophers were at sixes and

Continue to love me as you do. If Caesar has con-
quered, look out for my speedy arrival.
