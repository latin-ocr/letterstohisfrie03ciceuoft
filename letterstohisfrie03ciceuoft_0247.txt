CICERO To TERENTIA
Brundisium, June 19th, 47 B.c.

If you are well, all is right. Ι had determined, as
Ι wrote to you before, to send Cicero to meet Caesar,
but I have changed my intention, because I could hear
nothing about the latter's arrival. About everything
else, although there is nothing new, you will yet be
able to leam from Sicca what 1ny wishes are and what
Ι think must be done at this juncture. Ι am still
keeping Tullia with me. Take particular care of

your health. Good-bye. June 19th.
