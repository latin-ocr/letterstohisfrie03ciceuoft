INTRODUCTION

The Letters vary greatly in interest and style3
while many of them contain matter of the highest
literary or historica] value—aS, for instance, Cicero's
explanation of his political change of front (i. 9),
Sulpicius Rufus's letter of condolence to Cicero on
the death of his daughter Tullia (iv. 5) and Matius's
defence of his friendship for Caesar (xi. 28)—others
are no more than merely formal documents.

The text is based on that of Nobbe (1849); but
where there was an obvious call for emendation in
that text I have not hesitated to adopt other readings,
always with due acknowledgement.

Such universally accepted orthographical corree-
tions as cum for quum, consili for consilii, and
causa for caussa I have made as a matter of

eotrffieffyrren and Purser's exhaustive (it has

rightly been described as “monuniental’') Com-
mentary on the Correspondence of Cicero‘² I have
made constant reference, and owe more than I
can tell3 I have depended upon it, too, for the-
dates of the letters. Watson‘s Select Letters (with
the reeently revised edition by Mr. W. W. How),
and Pritchard and Bernard's selected Letters for the
use of Schools have been of invaluable assistance
to me, and I have freely consulted the admirable
translations of all or some of the letters by E. S.
Shuckburgh‚ G. E. Jeans, and S. H. Jeyes.

To all the above distinguished Ciceronians I
acknowledge with gratitude my very deep indebted-

neSS.
