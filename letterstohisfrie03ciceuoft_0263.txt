EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. 1.

were the first to report to me that large forces of the
Parthians had begun to cross the Euphrates. On
receipt of this report, seeing that there were certain
persons who did not consider that king altogether
to be trusted, I came to the conclusion that Ι ought
to wait for more definite information. On the 18th
September, as Ι was marching my army into Cilicia, on
the frontier line between Lycaonia and Cappadocia
I received a despatch from Tarcondimotusst who is re-
garded as our most loyal ally beyond Mount Taurus,
and the best friend of the Roman people. He re-
ported that Pacorus? son of Orodes, king of the
Parthians, had crossed the Euphrates with a very
strong force of Parthian cavalry, and pitched his
camp at Tyba, and that a serious uprising had been
stirred up in the province of Syria. On the same day I
received a despatch dealing with the same incidents
from Jambliehus,⁶ the leading tribesman ofthe Arabs,
a man who is generally considered to be loyally dis-
posed and friendly to our Republic.

On the receipt of this information, although I fully 3
understood that our allies had no firmly established
opinions, and were wavering in expectation of a re-
volution, yet Ι hoped that those whom I had already
approached, and who had had clear proof of my
clemency and probity, had now become more friendly
to the Roman people; and that Cilicia, moreover,
would be confirmed in its loyalty if allowed to share
the fruits of my equitable administration. For
that reason, and also with the intention of crushing
those of the Cilician people who had taken up arms
and of convincing our enemy in Syria that the army

dynasty of Emesa and Arethusa. He was put to death by
Antony just before the battle of Actium.
