EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxx-xvi.

But they have less effect upon me now, as you see ;
and so I turn from the grandiloquence of Homer, and
betake myself to the practieal precepts of Euripides 2

The sage, no sage for his own ends, I loathe‚⁰

a verse that Praecilius senior enthusiastically
applauds, and declares that a man may be able “ to
see before as well as behind ” b and yet nevertheless

Ever tto] proye himself best, and unrivalled to stand above
o ers.

But to return to the point with which I began : you 3
will oblige me very greatly if you extend to this
young man the courtesy you possess in so remarkable
a degree, and to add to what I imagine you would like
to do for the sake of the Praecilii themselves the
further wei ht of my recommendation.

I have εξορῒθᾶ a new style of letter in writing to
you, so that you may understand that this is no stereo-
typed recommendation.

CICERO TO ,IULIUS CAESAR
Rome (5²), early in 45 13.C.

Out of all our nobility the young man for whom l
I have the highest regard is P. Crassus (ἰ ; and while I
had entertained great hopes of him from his earliest
years, Ι began to have quite a brilliant impression of

battle of Carrhae. Cicero eulogized him in Brut. 5282. Cf.
Fam. v. 8. 4. His widow Cornelia afterwards became
the wife of Pompey.
