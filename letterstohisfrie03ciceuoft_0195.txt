you. Now Ι do sometimes confer this favour indis—
criminately, but I do so for the most part on my
particular friends, as on the present occasion. I am
extremely familiar and closely associated with T.
Ampius Balbus α ; his freedman T. Ampius Menan-
der, a sterling and unassuming fellow, is greatly
esteemed both by his patron and myself, and Ι
commend him to you with more than ordinary
warmth. You will do me a particular favour if you
serve his interests in whatever way you can without
inconveniencing yourself, and I earnestly beg you
again and again to do so.

CICERO TO 1115 COLLEAGUE P. SERVILIUS

Rome, mouth uncertain, 46 sc.

Now that. our intimacy and your goodwill towards
me is a matter of common knowledge, Ι find myself
obliged to recommend ever so many people to you.
But although all whom I recommend ought to have
my best wishes, I have not the same reason for such
wishes in every case. T. Agusius was not only my
companion during the most miserable period of my
life, but also shared with me all my journeys, voyages,
troubles, and dangers; nor would he have left my
side at the present time, had I not given him per-
mission. That is the reason I recommend him to you
as being one of my own household, and one of those
most closely attached to me. You will do me a very
great favour by so treating him as to convince him
that this recommendation has been of material service
and assistance to him.
