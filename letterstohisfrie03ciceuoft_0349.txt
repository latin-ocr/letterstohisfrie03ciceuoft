CICERO To Tmo ‘¹

Between Patrae and Alyzia, November 3, 50 13.c.

I, Tullius, my son Cicero, and my brother and his
son, send warmest greetings to Tiro.

I imagined I could bear the loss of your company l
somewhat easily, but I simply cannot bear it ; and
although it is highly important in view of my triumph
that I should reach the City as soon as possible, still
I think it was a mistake on my part to have left 3 our
side3 and as 3ou seemed to be absolutely unmlling
to take ship except when you had recovered 3our
strength, I approved your decision, and I am not now
changing my mind, if you are still of the same opinion.
If however, after you have taken nourishment, you
think you can catch me up, well, that is for you to
decide. My object in sending Mario b to you was in
order that he might join me as soon as possible and

work, and in preserving his correspondence. After C icero's
death he bought a farm near Puteoli, where, in spite of his
weak health, he reached the age of 100.

⁶ A slave of Cicero. Cf. Ep. 3. 2.
