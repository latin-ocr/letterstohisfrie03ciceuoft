CICERO TO TIRO
Astura, July 27, 45 mc.

Your letter makes me hope that you are better3 1
that, at any rate, is what Ι desire. Make every
thing subservient to that one object, and on no
account be apprehensive that you are acting con-
trary to my wishes in not being at my side. You
are at my side if you are taking care of yourself3
and for that reason I had rather have you the slave
of your own health than the slave of my eyes and
ears, For though it is a pleasure to me to hear
and see you, it will be far more delightful to do so if
you are well. I am idling here, because I am not
writing anything myself‚ but reading is a great
pleasure to me. Being where you are, I am sure
you will explain anything· the copyists cannot make
out on account of my handwriting. There is certainly
one rather difficult inserted passage, which even
Ι myself always find it hard to decipher‚ about Cato
at the age of four.a About the dinner-table, please
see to it, as I am sure you do. Tertiab will be there,
provided Publius has not been asked.

That Demetrius ⁰ of yours was never a De- 2
mettius of Phalerum at all, but now he is an ab-
solute Billienus. Ι therefore appoint you my repre-
sentative‚ Please show him some attention. “ And

⁶ See Epp. 17. ⁶2, and 19. Demetrius os Phalerum was
a very different man—cultured and erudite. The name
Demetrius suggests the Demetrius whose slave Billienus
strangled Domitius at Album Intimilium. For the story
see viii. 15. 2.
