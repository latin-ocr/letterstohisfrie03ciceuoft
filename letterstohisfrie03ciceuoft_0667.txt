EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, Ν.

that campaign without waiting for our commission
from the-Senate. In the same session Ι made such
reference to you as seemed appropriate. My speech
shall be communicated to yon, for I observe that you
take a delight in our ‘⁴ Philippics.'’

In answer to your inquiry about Ααῒοῐιὶαε,α my 3
view is that he ought to be kept in detention until wc
know the result of Brutus’ campaign. I gather from
the letter which you sent me that Dolabella is han-y-
ing Asia and is behaving atrociously in it. And yet
you have written to quite a number of people that
Dolabella had been shut out from Rhodes 3 but if he
went as far as Rhodes, it looks to me as if he had left
Asia. If that is a fact, I recommend that you should
stay where you are 3 but once he has captured
Rhodes—if that happens, believe me, you must pursue
him into Asia at once. It seems to me you could do
nothing better at this time.

Touching upon your remark that you are short of 4
two necessaries‚ fresh drafts and moneyss’ I am
puzzled what to propose to you. I cannot think of
any expedients to which in my view you could have
recourse, except the resolutions which the Senate
carried, that you should raise a loan among the free
communities. But I do not see what can be done
about reinforcements 3 for Pansa is so little disposed
to let you have any part of his army or of his new
levies, that he even takes offence at the numbers
which are joining you as volunteers. According to
my own belief, he estimates that no force can be too
large for the operations which are being decided on
in Italy 3 but the reason which many people surmise
is that he wants no one, not even you, to make too
firm a stand. This suspicion I do not share.
