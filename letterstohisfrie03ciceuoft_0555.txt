EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, II. ΧΠ.

Hospitalis,‘² and rouses a rally of all the Greeks, for it
was through them that we became reconciled.

I shall satisfy Theopompus. I forgot to write to 4
you about Caesar ; for I see what sort of a letter you
have been expecting. But he wrote to Balbus and
told him that the whole paeket of letters, in which
were mine and Balbus’s, was so soaked with water
when he received it that he did not even know there
was any letter from me. He had, however, made out
a few words in Balbus's letter, to which he replied in
the following words ε “ I see that you have written
something about Cicero,b which Ι could not under-
stand, but as far as I could conj eeture, it was the sort
of thing that I thought more to be desired than hoped
for.” So later on I sent Caesar an exact duplicate of 5
m letter.

yYou must not be put off with that little joke of
Caesar’s about his lack of means. My reply to it was
that there was no reason why he should in future make
a mess of his affairs by relying on my money—chest3
and I kept up the joke with him in that sort of way,
familiarly but without loss of dignity. His devotion
to us, however, as reported by messages from all
sides, is quite extraordinary. The letter bearing
upon what you are waiting for will practically coincide
with your return. Anything more that happens day
by day I will let you know by letter, provided only
that> you furnish me with letter-carriers„ And yet
the political barometer is so near freezing-point that
Appius is in extreme danger of having his house
burnt about his ears.⁶

Tyrrell takes suae aedes urerentur as meaning ‘⁴ his house
may befrost-bitten‚'' i.e.‚ utterly deserted by salutatores, etc.
