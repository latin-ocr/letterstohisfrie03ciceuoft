EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. vanL-Lxlx.

For my own part, I shall not often write and tell 2
you what I think about politics in general, since a
letter of that sort has its dangers 3 but about what is
actually going on, I shall write more often. In spite
of all, I am not, I think, without hope that our
colleague Caesar will be, and indeed is, anxious that
we should have a constitution worthy the name 3
and it was of great importance that you should play
your part in his deliberations. But if it is more to your
advantage, by which I mean, more to your honour
and glory, that you should be governor of Asia and
look after that part of the Republic, a part which has
suffered so cruelly, Ι too ought to pray preferably for
just that which is likely to be of benefit both to
yourself and to your reputation.

I shall attend with the utmost zeal and assiduity 3
to whatever Ι consider affects your prestige‚ and most
particularly shall I uphold in all reverence the dignity
of that most distinguished man, your father ‘² 3 and
indeed it is no less than my duty to do so, considering
our long-standing friendship, the kindnesses you have
both done me, and the honour due to your father
himself.

for his patron himself. At Ephesus, whenever I
happened to be there, I was as much at horne in his
house as in my own, and many things have occurred
