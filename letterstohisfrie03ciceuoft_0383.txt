literary work on hand; I cannot bring myself to
touch it, until I see you. Please give orders that
your doctor shall be promised whatever fee he asks.
I am writing to that effect to Ummius.‘¹
Ι am told that you are distressed in mind, and 2

to ensure this as much for my sake as for your own.

arrive. Again and again, good-bye. Noon‚ April

should write a longer letter if I thought you were
now able to enjoy the reading of it. Concentrate
your wits, of which I have the highest opinion,
