will think all the better of him for that. Be sure
then, my dear Rex, to give him the impression that
this letter has proved of invaluable service to him.

CICERO TO Q. MINUCIUS THERMUS,'¹ PROPRAETOR
Cilicia, probably towards the end of 51 13.c.

I have for long been on the most intimate terms 1
with L. Genucilius Curvus, a most excellent man, and
a very grateful fellow. I commend him to you most
heartily, and Ι introduce him to you first of all in
order that you may serve him in every respect, so far
as your honour and position permit (and they will
permit you in every respect) ; for there is no demand
he will ever make of you that is incompatible with
your character—and, I may add, with his own.

Especially, however, do Ι commend to you his 2
business affairs on the Hellespont, first so that you
should ensure his maintaining those rights in regard
to land which the community of Parium b granted him
by decree, and which he has always maintained
without dispute 3 and secondly, should he have any-
thing in the nature of a dispute with a Hellespontian,
you should refer the matter to the above-mentioned
department, But seeing that Ι have commended the
man to you So very earnestly in his entirety, it does
not seem to me necessary to set out his claims
piecemeal. Let me sum up thus ε whatever obliga-
tion, kindness, or honour you bestow upon Genucilius,
I shall consider you to have bestowed upon myself

and my interestS.
