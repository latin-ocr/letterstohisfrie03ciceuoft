EPIST. AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. ,κῃ-κη.

The Magnesians from Sipylus made a compli- 3
mentary reference to you, to the effect that you were
the only man to stand up against the demand of L.
Sextius Pansa.‘² During the days that remain, if any- 4
thing occurs which it is necessary for you to know, or
even if nothing occurs, Ι shall nevertheless write some-
thing to you every day. On February 12, Ι shall not
fail either you or Pomponius.

The poems of Lucretius are just as you write- 5
with frequent flashes of genius, and yet exceedingly
artistic.b But when you come . . . ⁶ If you get
through Sallust’s Empedoclea, Ι shall think you a fine
fellow, but no ordinary mortal.

CICERO ΤΟ QUINTUS IN THE COUNTRY

Rome, February 13, 54 13.C.

I arn delighted that you were pleased with my l
letter3 and yet Ι should not have had any material
for a letter even then, had Ι not received yours. For,

Munro suggests another reading, which may be rendered
“as for any great artistry, however, if you discover the
poems to possess it, I shall think you a hero’'; and Bergk
yet another, meaning “They do not, however, show much
artistry. But if you read them to the last page, Ι shall
think you a hero.'' (See critical note.)

It is after all possible that the ars in our text may not
mean “artistic finish'’ at all, but simply “the scientific
treatment of a subject’⁸—here ars physica (natural science),
as we have ars metrica, yrammatica, rhetorica. In that case
the passage would mean “ The poems contain ‘purple patches '
of genius in plenty, but for all that they are extremely
ffichnicalss'm which is no unfair description of the De Rerum

utura.

⁶ Supply some such words as “ we can discuss the matter.'’
