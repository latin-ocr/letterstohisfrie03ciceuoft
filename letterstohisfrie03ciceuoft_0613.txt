EPIS'I'ULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, 111. 111.

the hatred all classes entertain for him ; he is·
damaged most of all by witnesses 3 he has the most
ineffective accusers 3 the panel of jurors is of a
promiscuous kind3 the presiding praetor, Alfius,⁰ is
a man of strong and sterling character3 Pompey is
very active in soliciting the jurors. What will happen
Ι don't know, but I cannot see that there is any room
for him in the State. My own feelings as regards his
condemnation are under control, as regards the issue
of events perfectlv placid.

I have now told you about almost ever3thing. 4
There is one thing Imust add3 your Cicero (and
indeed he is our Cicero) 1s deeply dev oted to hisrhetoric
master Paeonius, in my opinion, an exceedingl3 w-ell
t1ained and excellent fellow. But, as you are well
aware, m3 own system of instruction is some33hat
more scholarly and argumentativest’ Ι do not there-
fore desire that your Cicero’s educational course
should be interfered with, and the boy himself
appears to be more attracted and charmed by that
declamatory st3 l3e and since Ι m3 self once followed
that line, let us allow him to proceed along the 5 ame
paths as I did3 for I feel sure that he 33 1ll arri3e at
the same goal. But, all the same, if Ι take him
with me into the country anywhere, I shall bring
him over to this system and practice of my own.
For the reward ⁰ you have set before me is a mag-
nificent one, and it will certainly not be through
any fault of mine that I shall forfeit it. I should like
you to write and tell me as exactly as possible, where,
and with what prospects in view, you are going to
spend the winter. Good-bye.
