EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. 111.

clcssno To M. CATO⁰
Camp at leonium, August 28, 51 13.c.

Ambassadors sent to me by Antiochus of Comma- 1
gene having arrived at my camp near Iconium on the
28th August, and having reported to me that the son
of the king of the Parthians, whom the sister of the
king of the Armenians had married, had reached the
banks of the Euphrates with very large Parthian
lorces and a large a1 my of many other nations besides,
and that it w as osaid that the Armenian king intended
making an attack upon Cappadocia, I thought that,
considering our intimate connexion, it was incumbent
upon me to send you this letter.

Ι sent no public despatch for two reasonS, because 2
the ambassadors told me that the Commagenian him-
self had immediately sent messengers with a despatch
to the Senate, and because I thought that the pro-
consul, Μ. Bibulus, who had set out from Ephesus to
Syria by sea about the lssth ofAugust, hav mg found the
w inds 1n his favour, had already arriv ed m his province,
and Ι supposed that his despatches would convey more
definite information on all points to the Senate. For
myself, in view of the present situation, and the

gravity of the war, my chief concern is to secure by
my leniency and moderation and by the fidelity of the
allies what I am scarcely strong enough to secure
with the forces at my disposal. I would have you, on
your part, show your regard for me and defend me,
as you have always done, in my absence.
