EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, ix.

the field against Dolabella. Ι gave him my support
and added this rider, that you should take the field
against Dolabella, if you should decide that this was
expedient and in the interests of the state ; but that

let us know what decision you have reached, and
what measures you are taking.
