CICERO GREETS C. JULIUS CAESAR, IMPERATOR

Astura, end of March, 45 B.c.⁰

I most particularly commend to you Praecilius, the 1
son of a very excellent gentleman who is your close,
and my own very intimate, friend. l am amazingly
fond of the young man himself on account of his
sobriety of conduct, his refinemcn’c, and his remark-
ably affectionate feeling for myself3 and his father
too, as practical experience has 'taught me and con-
vinced me beyond all doubt, was always my very
sincere friend. Why, he was the man who more than
anybody used to scoff at and scold me because
I did not attach myself ’co you, especially when you
invited me to do so in the most complimentary termst

But with his words never swayed he the beart that beats
in my bosom.‘'

For I heard our chieftains crying aloud :

“Stand thou undaunted, that men e'en in ages to come
may extol thee.'' ⁶
So spake he, but the other a black cloud of anguish
enveloped.‘¹

But still those same men offer me comfort, and 2
even now they would set on fire a poor fellow already
scorched with the flames ofa futile ambition 3 and this

is ’the sort of thing they say :

Not without effort of mine, and not without fame, would
But lilialz‘e'iblghdone such a deed as will ring through the ages
or ever.
