auction takes place before my arrival, let Pomponius,
or failing him, Camillus,⁰ manage the business for us.
As soon as I have got safe home, Ι shall do what
remains to be done myself3 but even if you have
already started from Rome you will still please see
that what I have indicated is done. With heaven’s
help, we hope to be in Italy about Nov. jath. My
dearest and sweetest Terentia, and my darling
Tullia, as you love me, take care of your health.

CICERO TO TERENTIA AND TULLIA
Dyrrachium, J uly 15th, 48 B.c.

Tbere is not often anybody to whom I could
entrust a letter, and I have nothing that I should
care to write. I learn from the letter I last received
from you that no estate could be sold, so please
consider, both of you, how the claims of that person
are to be satisfied, who, as you both know, I am
anxious should be satisfied. As to our daughter’s
thanking you, I am not surprised that your services
are such as to enable her to thank you with good
reason. If Pollex ὓ has not yet started, be sure you
give him a push out as soon as possible. Mind you
keep well. July l5th.
