EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XVI. 1.-11.

bring you with him, or else, if you made any stay, that
that he might immediately return to me.

You must, however, convince yourself of this, that if 2
it can be managed without detriment to your health,
nothing would please me more than to have you with
me 3 if, on the other hand, you feel sure that a short
stay at Patrae is essential to your convalescence‚ that
nothing would please me more than to have you well.
If you take ship at once, you will catch me up at
Leucas ; but if you desire to establish your health, you
must see to it very carefully that you get the fellow-
passengers‚ the weather‚ and the ship that exactly
suit you. Be particularly mindful‚ my dear Tiro, as
you love me, not to let Mario’s arrival, and this letter,
influence your plans. If you do what is most con·
ducive to your health, you will best obey my wishes.
Think it over, and use your own judgment. For
myself‚ I long for your presence, but it is as one who
loves you ; love urges ‘⁴ Let me see you in good
health '’; longing “ Let it be with all speed.” The
former consideration then should come first. Above
everything‚ therefore, take care of your health3 of
all your countless kindnesses to me this will be the
most gratifying. Nov. Srd.

CICERO TO TIRO
Alyzia‚⁰ November 5, 50 13.c.

I have neither the power nor the inclination to write
and tell you what my feelings are ; Ι only tell you that
the greatest pleasure either you or I can enjoy will
be my seeing you in robust health as soon as may be.
