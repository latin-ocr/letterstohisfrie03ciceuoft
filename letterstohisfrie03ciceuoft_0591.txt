EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. 1.

me with the shy way Ι made the request. If I
canvass for anybody besides (as I told Oppius to
write to Caesar) Ι 311311 have little objection to a
refusal, since those who pester 1116 with requests
decidedly object to my refusing 1116111.α Ι esteem

but, to avoid 61111 dissension, he retired from Rome.
Cicero here imp lies that he could have defied Piso, had
he chosen to dop so, as Metellus could have deficd Min-ius,
but decided to treat him with silent contempt. Cf. Fam. i.
9. 16, where Cicero again compares himself to Metellus.
