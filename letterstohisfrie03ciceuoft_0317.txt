EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. xm.

you with no economy of words to ensure that the
decree of the Senate concerning my achievements
should be couched in the most complimentary
terms possible, yet I do not venture to lay undue
stress upon my petition to you, lest Ι should either
appear to have forgotten your habitual and 1111111161·-
rupted kindness to me, or to imvrine that you have
forgotten it.

I shall therefore do as I believe you would hav e me 3
do, and use but few words m making a request of one
who, as all the nations of the world are aware, has de-
served extremely well of me. W'ere there other consuls,
you are the first man, Paullus, to whom I should send,
requesting you to enlist their warmest friendship on
my side. As it is, seeing that you possess the highest
power and influence, and that our close connexion is
known to all men, I ask you in all earnestness to en-
sure that the decree concerning my achievements is
couched in the most complimentary terms possible,
yes, and as speedily as possible too‚ That those
services are deserving of honour and congratulation
y ou will discov er from the despatch I sent m my public
capacity to yourself and your colleague and the
Senate3 and I should be glad ify ou would undertake
to look after all my other interests, and most especi-
ally my reputation, an 1(1 pal ticularhy to see to it, as I
asked y ou to do m a former letter alSO, that there is no
extension of my term of office.

I am anxious to see y ou while y ou are consul, and
during your consulship to secure all I hope for, not
only here but at home.
