CICERO 'ro QUINTUS lN SARDINIA
Rome, January 17, .·561³.<.

It was not pl essuie of business (though I am sorely l
hampered' ln that respect), but a slight inflammation
of the eyes that induced me to dictate this letter
instead of writing it, as I geneiall) do when corre-
sponding with you, with my own hand. And first
of all I excuse myself to you on the very point on
which I accuse you. For nobody so far has asked me
whether I have any commands for Sardinia, while you,
I fancy, often have people inquiring whether you have
any commands for Rome. You wrote to me on
behalf of Lentulus and Sestius ; well, Ι have spoken
to Cincius.⁰ However the matter stands, it is not
of the easiest. But assuredly there is something
in Sardinia peculiarly conducive to recalling past
memories 3 for just as the great Gracchus? the augur,
on his arrival in that province, recollected what had
happened to him when holding the consular elections
in the Campus Martius contrary to the auspices, so
it seems to me that you in your moments of leisure
in Sardinia ha. e bethought )Οιι·ι561ί“ afresh of the
house- -·plin of Numisius⁰ and your debts to Porn-
ponius. So far Ι have bought nothing. Culleo’ s
auction is ov er and done with3 my Tusculan property
found no purchaser If I have a very favour able offer
for it, it is just possible I may not let it slip.

As regards your building, Inever cease hurrying 2
on Cyrusfl I hope he will do his duty ; but every-
thing hangs fire owing to the prospect of a madcap
aedileship ⁰ ; for the elections seem likely to be held
without delay. They are announccd for J anuary 20.
