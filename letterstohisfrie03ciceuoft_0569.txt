EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. va.

XVB

CICERO To QUINTUS IN GAUL
Rome, July 527, 54 B.c.

For this letter I shall use a good pen, well-mixed 1
ink, and ivory-polished α paper too. For you write
that you could hardly read my last, but for that
there were none of those reasons which you suspect,
my dear brother. Ι was not busy, nor upset, nor
angry with someone, but it is always my practice to
use whatever pen I find in my hand as if it were a
good one.

But now, my best and dearest of brothers, let me 2
have your attention while Ι reply to what you have
written in such a very business-like manner in this
short letter I have before me. As to the matter about
which you beg of me to write back to you, concealing
nothing, withholding nothing, not sparing your feel-
ings, but frankly, and as a brother should—I mean
whether you are to wing your way home as we had
arranged, or to stay on to clear yourself of liabilities,
if there be any reason to do so—well‚ my dear
Quintus, if the matter in regard to which you in-
quired what Ι wished were a small one, yet, though
I should have allowed you to do what you wished, I
should have shown you what I myself wished. In this
matter, however, the real meaning of your inquiry is
——what sort of a year do I expect next year to be ?
I expect it to be either an entirely tranquil one for us
or, at any rate, an impregnable one in respect of my
position ; and this is clearly proved every day at my
house, in the forum, and by manifestations of feeling
