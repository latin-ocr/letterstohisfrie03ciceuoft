CICERO To BRUTUS
Rome, July 14, 43 κο.

That is a brief note of yours ; brief, I say t nay l
rather, it amounts to nothing. Can Brutus addi-ess
me in days like these in three short lines ἶ· Had Ι
been in your place, Ι should rather not have written
at all. And you ask for a note from me! What
courier of yours ever reached you without a letter of
mine? And which letter did not contain a heavy
budget? If these haven’t been delivered to you,
I conclude that not even your home correspondence
has come to hand. You say you will give a longer
letter to my son Cicero. Good so far, but this one too
should be more substantial. For my part, as soon as
you informed me that Cicero had parted company
with you, I at once bundled off a courier and a note
to Cicero, bidding him return to you, even if he had
arrived in Italy3 for nothing could give me more
satisfaction or give him more credit. And yet Ι had
told him in several letters that the election for the
priesthoods had been postponed to another year-—
a result for which I fought tooth and nail. Ι went to
these pains both for the sake of Cicero and of
Domitius, Cato, Lentulus, and the Bibuli‘23 this I
notified to you also. But obviously you had not yet
received word of it when you sent off that tiny note
of yours to me.
