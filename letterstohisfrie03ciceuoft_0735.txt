EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xan—xxw.

Therefore, dear Brutus, I urge you most emphati- 2
cally not to let my son Cicero leave you, but to bring
him back with you ; and your own return, if you have
any regard for the free state to which you are dedi-
cated, must take place now and at once. For the
war has re-started, and this on a large scale, thanks
to the criminal act of Lepidus. And the forces of
Caesar, which were excellent, are not merely of no
use but even compel me to clamour for your army. If
this is landed in Italy, no citizen worth the name will
fail to betake himself to your camp. We have in our
favour, it is true, the junction of Brutus with Plancus ‘²
—a splendid achjevement ; but you know well how
uncertain are the minds of men when corrupted by
party intrigue, and the issues of battles. Moreover
if, as I hope, victory is ours, even so the situation will
require the strong guidance of your counsel and your
moral influence. In Heaven's name, then, come to
our rescue, and that with all possible speed, and be
convinced that you did your country no greater ser-
vice on the Ides of March, when you struck away the
chains of servitude from your fellow-citizens, than you
will yet render it, if you arrive betimes. J uly 14.
