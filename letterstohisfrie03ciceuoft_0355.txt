CICERO TO TIRO
Leucas, November 7, 50 13.c.

Ι, Tullius, and Cicero, and 1ny brother Quintus and
his son, send warmest gleetings to their dear Tiro.
I was variously affected b3 your letter, beingl

seriously disturbed by the first page, but a little

at great length3 among other things too, that if it
be your pleasule, he should take. you over into his

one thing, my dear Tiro, I beg of you to do—spare
no expense in any respect, if it be necessar3 for 3our
health. I ha3e written to Curius to advance 3ou
