deor '' should be added. But, since you wish it, let
us avoid provoking unfavourable comment, which, Ι
must say, I have often treated with contempt. Ι am
delighted that the sudorifics have done you good.
But if my Tusculan villa has done so too, good

play3 hitherto, while ministering so devotedly to
me, you have not ministered to it enough. What it
demands you are well aware—-good digestion,
avoidance of fatigue, a proper amount of walking,

say answers your wishes‚‘' adding that procedere in modum
denotes undisturbed rhythmical movement, hence movement
in accordance with one’s wishes.
