EPIST. AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxx'111b.—xxlx.

have Ι myseff, because I know you so very well, ever
doubted that you were thoroughly acquainted with
the rights and nierits of nationalities. And so, when
asked by Philippus, the Lacedaemonian, to recom-

I was under every obligation to that state, yet I
replicd that the Lacedaemonians stood in no need
of any recommendation with you.

I would therefore have you believe that I con· 2
sider all the states of Achaia, in view of the dis—

for their governor, and I have, moreover, convinced
myself that you, because you are better acquainted
than any living man, not only with our own history,
but also with the whole history of Greece, are now,
and ever will be, of your own choice a friend to
Lacedaemonians. For that reason I merely beg of
yon, when you do for the Lacedaemonians all that
your conscience, dignity, and sense of justice shall
demand, to convey to them, if you please, the impres-

be made to believe that I charge myself with their
interests. This I earnestly beg of you again and again
to do.
