INTRODUCTION

their language contained specimens of Silver Age
latinity3 (2) that they perpetrated errors of fact,
relating to the situation of 43 B.C.‚ such as would have
been impossible to Cicero and Brutus ; (3) that they
were not in keeping with the characters and accom-
plishments of Cicero and of Brutus, as revealed to us
in the other works of Cicero and in Plutareh's “ Life
of Brutus.”

A closer examination of the “ Letters to Brutus ’'
has shown to the general satisfaction of modern
scholars that most if not all of thern are genuine.
For some of the alleged speeimens of Silver Age latin-
ity parallels have been addueed from undoubtedly
genuine works of Cicero 3 and most of the apparent
historie-al errors have been disposed of by re-arranging
the pieees in their correct chronological order. The
only letters whose authenticity is not generally ae-
cepted are nos. XVII and XXV (I. 17 and 16),
addressed by Brutus to Atticus and to Cicero respect-
ively.⁶⁸ These arouse suspicion by the poverty of
their argument and the abruptness,not to say incoher-
enee of their style, which would seem unworthy of a
well-edueated man like Brutus. But the argument of
these letters turned on highly controversial questions
of public poliey in which Brutus had a difficult ease to
uphold ; and if we bear in mind that behind his Stoic
pose there lurked a hot and stubborn temperss’ we
need not be surprised that he should in these two

letters, L. Gurlitt‚ maintains that no. XXIV (l. 15) is made up
of two authentie letters (ἐξ 1-2 and 1:2-13) and an interpolated
middle piem· (ᾗῇ 3-1 l).
