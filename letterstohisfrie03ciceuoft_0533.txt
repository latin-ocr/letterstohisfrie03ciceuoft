about Pompey, it has utterly collapsed. It is not
a popular proposal in itself, and our friend Pompey
is censurcd for his breach of friendship with Lentulus,
and, upon my honour, he is not the man he was. For
his support of Milo is not altogether agreeable to
those who constitute the worst and lowest dregs of
