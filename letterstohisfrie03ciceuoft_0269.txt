EPISTULAF, AD FAMILIARES, XV. 11.

Cappadocia, as I had strong grounds for suspecting
that if the Parthians tried to issue out of Syria and
burst their way into my province, they would advance
through Cappadocia, as offering least resistance.

I accordingly marched with my army through that 2
part of Cappadocia which adjoins Cilicia, and pitched
my camp near Cybistra, a town at the foot of Mount
TauruS, so as to let Artavasdes, the king of Armenia,
whatever his attitude of mind might be, know that
there was an army of the people of Rome not far from
his frontier, and so as to have Deiotarus,‘² a most loyal
king and the best of friends to our Republic, in close
contact with me, so that the Republic might have the
assistance of his counsel and resources.

Having encamped at this spot, and having des· 3
patched my cavalry into Cilicia, in order that the an-
nouncement of my arrival to the communities in that
district might confirm them all in their loyalty, and
also that I myself might have early information as to
what was going on in Syria, I thought it incumbent
upon me to spend the three days of my stay in that
camp in the performance of an important and neces-
sary duty.

For since you had intervened with a resolution 4
that I should protect King Ariobarzanes,¹’ entitled
“ Eusebes '' and “ PhilorhomaeuS,’' and defend that
monarch’s personal safety and the stability of his
realm, and in short, safeguard both king and king-
dom, and since you had added that the security of that
king was a matter of grave anxiety to the people and

opposed the Liberators‚ but was put to death by Cassius.
'l‘he titles of Eusebes, “the Dutiful‚” and Philorhomaeus,
“the Lover of Rome‚'' must have been g1ven him by the
Pompeian party.
