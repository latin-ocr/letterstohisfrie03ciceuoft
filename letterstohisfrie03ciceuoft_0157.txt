CICERO TO MANIUS AslLlUS (ΪιΙΛΑΒΗΙΟ,α PROCONSUL
Rome (ἓ), Jannnry, 44 uc.

In view of your respect for me, of which I had con· 1
vincing proof all the time I was at Brundisium, I have
presumed so far as to address you with familiarity,
and as though I had the right to do so, if there were
·1nything that caused me serious anxiety.

M’. Curius, who has a banking business at Patrae,
is so intimate with me that no associition could
possibly be closer. His services to me have been
many, and so have mine been to him, and (what is
most important of all) our affection for each other is
as sincere as it is mutu il

That being so, if you have anything to hope for 2
from my friendship, if you would even enhance my
gratitude, profound as it already is, for the cordial
kindnesses you heaped upon me at Brundisium, if
you observe that all your friends regard me with
affection, then 1 say, grant me of your bounty this one
favour—keep M. Curius “ w-ater tight and weather-
proof'’ ὁ as they say, free from the slightest taint
and touch of disaster, damage, or disti ess Ι myself
guarantee, and all y our friends will pledge themselves
to you on my behalf, that you 55111 find the combina-
tion of my friendship for you with your kindnes 55 to
me a source of immense profit and infinite pleasure
to you-
