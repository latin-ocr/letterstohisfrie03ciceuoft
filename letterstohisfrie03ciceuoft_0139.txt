conferred upon him held good.

I was anxious that you should know this, so that you 2
might count him among the citizens of Rome, and in
all other respects I commend him to you with as much
earnestness as Ι have ever commended anybody.
You will give me extreme pleasure if you so treat him
as to make him feel that my recommendation has
conferred great distinction upon him.

CICERO To MANJUS ΑΕΗ-ωε GLABRIO, PROCONSUL
Rome (ἓ). 45 B.c.

I commend to you with more than ordinary warmth
Hippias of Calacte.‘¹ son of Philoxenus, as being
closely bound to me by ties ot= hospitality. liis
property, as the matter has been reported to me. is
being held by the State, in contravention of the laws
of Calacte, on account of a debt for which he is not
responsible. If that is so, the circumstances them-
selves, even without any recommendation of mine,
ought to prevail upon a man with your sense of
justice to give him your assistance. But howsoever
the matter stands, I beg of you for my credit’s sake
to release him from his difficulties. and to oblige him
both in this and in every other respect so far as is
compatible with your honour and position. Your
doing so will give me extreme pleasure.
