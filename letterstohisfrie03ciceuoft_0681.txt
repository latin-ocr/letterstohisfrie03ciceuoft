EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, vn.

to his efforts ; and to be sure, if he had not drawn
Antony away from the city, all would have been lost.

And yet, three or four days before this glorious 2
event the entire citizen body, as if unnerved with
fear, was fain to stream out to you with family and
all ; yet on April 20 they had recovered their nerve
and would rather that you should come here than
that they should go to you. That was the day on
which Ι gathered the full harvest of my hard toil
and frequent vigiIS, if any substantial harvest can
indeed accrue from a well-founded and genuine re-
nown ; for the crowd that flocked round me was as
vast as our city could contain. Ι was escorted by it
right up to the Capitol and then was made to take my
stand on the Rostrafl amid huge acclamation and
applause. I am not at all being vain3 there is no
justification for that. But all the same, I am deeply
impressed by the unanimity of all classes, by their
thanksgivings and felicitations, and for this reason,
that it is glorious to achieve popularity in the cause
of the people's safety. But Ι would sooner you heard
about this from others.

Please spare no pains to keep me informed of your 3
position and your pohcy, and bear in mind that your
generosity must not give an impression of a loss of
firm purpose. This is the Senate's, this is the people’s
conviction‚ that no enemy ever deserved more richly
the utmost rigour of punishment than those citizens
who took up arms against their country in this war.
These are the men whom I castigate and pursue in all
my pronouncementS‚ with the approval of all loyal
men. You must judge for yourself how you feel
about this ; my feeling is that the three brothers are
one and all in the same case.
