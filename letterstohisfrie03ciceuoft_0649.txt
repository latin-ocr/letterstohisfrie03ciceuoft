in the archetype. In three cases (Bk. I. 2, 2a ; 3, 3a ;
4, 4a) two distinct letters have been amalgamated
into one composite piece. Minor errors in the MSS.
are neither numerous nor important.

The most recent editions by modern scholars are
those of L. C. Purser (Clarendon Press, 1903); of
H. Sjogren (Teubner, 1914) ; and of W. Y. Tyrrell
and L. C. Purser (The Cor-respondeum of Cicero, Qud
edition, vol. vi. ε Dublin University Press and Long-
mans, Green ; 1933).

The text of Tyrrell and Purser, which closely follows
that of Sjogren, has been adopted in the present
volume, with a few alterations which are indicated in
the footnotes. The letters are printed in the chrono-
logical order established by Tyrrell and Purser.
Like all students of Cicero's correspondence, the
present translator has derived much assistance from
the introduction and notes to Tyrrell and Purser’s
edition.

Further details about the MS. tradition will be found
in the Introduction to Sjogren’s text and in an article

by H. Sternkopf (Hermes, 1911, pp. 355-375).

controversy which lasted until the later years of the
nineteenth century. The main reasons advanced
against the genuineness of the letters were t (1) that

bridge man, Dr. Conyers Middleton.
