CICERO 'ro QtJiNTUS
Thessalonica, early in August, 58 [ΜΞ.

Ι entreat you, by my love, my dear brother, do not, 1
if through my fate I alone have brought ruin upon
you and all who are mine, do not attribute it to any
criminality or guilt on my part, so much as to a pitiable

inconceivably base that I should be deceived, and
indeed imagined that it was not even to their own
interest. All my most intimate, my nearest, and my
dearest friends, were either panio-struck on their own
account, or were jealous of me. So Ι lacked nothing,
poor wretch, but fair dealing on the part of my
friends and cautious counsel on my own.

generally felt for you have delivered you from per-
secution at the present juncture, you are surely in a
position to know whether there is left to me any hope
whatever of being recalled. Pomponius and Sestius
and my son-in-law Piso have so far held me back at
Thessalonica, forbidding me to go further afield on
account of some developments or other ; but it was
their letters rather than any definite hope of my own
that induced me to await the issue of those develop-
ments. For what hope have Ι left, with a most power-
ful enemy, with my detractors in supreme command,
my friends faithless, and so many envious of me?

However, of the new tribunes, Sestius, it is true, is 3
most sincerely devoted to me, and so, I hope, are
