CASSIUS TO CICERO

Brundisium, latter half of January, 45 B.c.

If 3ou are 33 ell, all is right. I assure 3ou that on l
this tour of mine there 15 nothing that gives me more
pleasure to do than to write to y ou, f01 I seem to be
talking andjoking 33 ith y ou face to face. And 3 et that
does not come to pass because of 3our “Catian
spectres' ἀς and, by way of letaliation for that, in
my next letter Ι shall let loose upon 3 ou such a
rabble of Stoic bools that you 33 ill pl oclaim Catius a
true-born Athenian.⁶

I am glad that our friend Pansa was sped on his way 2
by universal goodwill when he left the city in military
uniform,⁶ and that not only on my own account, but
also, most assuredly, on that of all our friends. For I
hope that men generally will come to understand how
much all the world hates cruelty, and how much it loves
integrity and clemency, and that the blessings most
eagerl3 sought and cmeted by the bad ultimately
find their 33 ay to the good. For it 15 hard to nominee
men that“ the good ιε to be chosen for its <mn salce'’ iS3
but that‘ ‘pleasure '' and‘ ‘tranquzllity of mind”
acquired by virtue, justice, and“ the goodj' is botlh
true and demonstrable. Why, Epicurus himself, from
whom all the Catiuses and Amafiniuses α in the
w,orld incompetent translator-s of terms as the3 are,

Journey to Caesar in Spain, to which both passages refer.
He returned, houexer to Rome befme he took up the
governmship of Cisalpine Gaul 1n March, 45.

‘¹ C. Amafinius’s books on Epicureanism had a great
vogue, though written in an uncouth style.
