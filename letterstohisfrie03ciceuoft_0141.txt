EPIST. AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxxv111.—xxxix.

CICERO 'ro MANIUS ACILIUS GLABRIO, PROCONSUL
Rome (ἓ), 45 1³.c.

L. Bruttius, a Roman knight and in every respect
a distinguished young man, is among my most
intimate friends, and is most punctilious in his atten-
tions to me ; and I have been great friends with his
father ever since my Sicilian quaestorship.‘² To be
sure Bruttius himself is at Rome with me, but I none
the less commend to you him, his house, his estate,
and his agents, with as much warmth as I could put
into any recommendation. It will give me extreme
pleasure if you make a point of convincing Bruttius
(and Ι have pledged my word to him that it will be
so) that this recommendation of mine has been of
material assistance to him.

XXXIX

elcssno To MANms ACILIUS GLABRIO, PROCONSUL
Rome (ἓ), 45 B.c.

I have a close connexion of long standing with the
Titurnian family, and the only survivor of that family
is M. Titurnius Rufus, whom it is my duty to support
with all the assiduity and civility I possibly can. It
is within your power then to make him believe that
the protection he looks for in me is adequate. For
that reason I recommend him to you with more than
ordinary warmth, and beg of you so to act as to con-
vince him that this recommendation of him has been
of material assistance to him. Your doing so will
give me no little pleasure.
