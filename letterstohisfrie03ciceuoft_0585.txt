EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. 1.

I thought it might have been a public highway,
except for 150 paces,—for Ι measured it myself
from the little bridge near the temple of Furina,‘²

all the proposed addition will be charming. Your
landscape - gardener won my praise ; he has so
enveloped everything with ivy, not only the founda-
