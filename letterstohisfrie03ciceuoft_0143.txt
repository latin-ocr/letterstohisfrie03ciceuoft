c1cm³0 To Q. ANCHARmsfl Pnocoxsm„
Rome, 55 13.C.

Ι recommend to you with more than ordinary
warmth Lucius and Gaius Aurelius, the sons of Lucius,
with whom, as with their father, a most excellent
man, I am exceedingly intimate ; they are young men
distinguished in all the best accomplishments, very
closely associated with myself, and in every way
worthy of your friendship. If any recommendation
of mine has ever had any influence with you—and,
as to that, I know that many have had the greatest
influence—I ask you to let this do so. If you
treat them honourably and handsomely, you will not
only win the attachment of two very grateful and
excellent young men, but you will also give me the

greatest possible pleasure.

As regards what you have done for L. Lucceius,c 1
I wish you distinctly to understand that you have
obliged the most grateful of men 3 and while all you
have done gives great pleasure to Lucceius himself,
Pompey also, whenever he sees me (and he sees me
often), thanks you with quite unusual warmth. This
much too I may add—and I am perfectly sure you
