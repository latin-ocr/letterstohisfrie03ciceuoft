CICERO To TERENTIA AND TULLIA

Minturnae, June 23rd, 49 13.c.

Tullius sc> esnd his bes t love to 'lew ntia and her father
to Tullia, the two darlings of his beart, as does Cicero
to his best of mothers and sw eetest of sisters.

If you tuo are w,ell so are we It lies with you 1
now, and not with me alone, to consider what we
should do, lf Caesar is going to enter Rome in an
orderly manner, you can quite well remain at home
for the present3 but if m his frenzy the man is going
to give up the city to plunder, I fear that ev en Dola-
bella may not be able to help us enough I am
afraid also that u e may be presently cut off from yon,
so that when you wish to leav e the city, you may not
be allowed to do so. There remains the question,
which nobody can discuss better than yourselve5‚
whether ladies like you are staying in Rome. For
if they are not, we must consider whether you can
do so with any propriety. As matters now stand, pro-
vided I am allow ed to retain those places of mine,
you can quite nicely stay either with me, or on one
of our estates. Another reason for apprehension is,
that before long there may be a famine in the city.

I'should like you both to consider these matters 2
with Pomponius, with Camillus, with whomever you
think best ; above all be of good courage. Labienus
