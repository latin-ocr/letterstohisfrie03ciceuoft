EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. ιν.

Curius,‘² Milo, Fadius,⁶ and Fabricius3 but Clodius
is bitterly opposed to me, and even in his private
capacity will be able to ronse the passions of public
gatherings with the same old gang ; and again there
is this too—someone will be put up to veto the bill.
All this was not put before me as I was leaving 4
Rome, but it was repeatedly stated that I should be
returning in three days’ time with the greatest ¹QIory.
“ Why did you go, then ? ’¹ you will say. Why ?
Well, many things occurred together to upset my
mental balance—the sudden defection of Pompey,
the estrangement of the consuls,c and of the praetors
also, the timid attitude of the publicani, the gangs of
armed roughs. The tears of my family prevented me
from putting myself to death, which was certainly the
course best adapted to the retention of my honour and
my escape from unendurable sufferings. But I wrote
to you on this point in the letter l gave Phaethon.
As it is, now that you have been thrust into such a
morass of grief and trouble as no man ever was before,
ifyou, by exciting the compassion of the world, can be
the means of mitigating our common missortune, you
will undoubtedly win a success of unimaginable im-
portance ; but if we are both irrevocably ruined (woe
is me !)‚ I shall prove to have brought destruction upon
all my people, to whom previously I was no discredit.
But, as I wrote to you before, scrutinize and probe 5

the situation thoroughly‚ and report to me fully and
truthfully, as our actual position and not your affec-
tion forme dictates. I shall keep my holdonlife as long
as I think that it is to your interest, or that it should
be preserved for the possibility of hope. You will fmd
Sestius a true friend to uS, and I believe Lentulus
wishes you all succeSS, and he will be consul. And
