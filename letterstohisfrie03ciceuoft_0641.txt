EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. ix.

any trial at all,‘² if by a dictator, even then without
risk of condemnation. There is no hatred of him,
and Hortensius’s warni defence will greatly strengthen
his case. The acquittal of Gabinius is regarded as
an Act of General Amnesty. En passant,—after all,
nothing has yet been done about a dictator. Pompey
is away ; Appius is making mischief 3 Hirrus is on
the warpatn , many tribunes are reckoned upon as
ready to veto ; the people are apathetic ; the leading
men object to it, and as for myself, I lie low.

For your promise about the slaves, Ι heartily bless 4
you ; and it is true that both at Rome and on my
estates I am short-handed. But be sure, my dear
brother, that you do not contemplate doing anything
with a view to my convenience, unless it is entirely
convenient to yourself‚ and quite within your means.

I laughed over Vatinius’s letter. But I know he 5
has such a respect for me b that I swallow his bitter
animosities Without suffering indigestion.

As to your urging me to finish my job, I have now 6
finished my ‘⁶ epic '' to Caesar, and a charming one
it is, in my opinion ; but I am in search of a trust-
worthy letter-carrier, so that it may not meet with
the same mishap as your Erigona; she is the only
traveller who did not find the journey from Gaul a
safe one since Caesar has been in chief command.⁶

What do you mean? If the quarry-stone I had 7
was not good, was I to pull down the whole building ζ’
and a building that pleases me more every day, and
the lower arcade in particular and the chambers
connected with it are being properly constructed.
As for Arcanum‚d it is an edifice worthy of Caesar,

‘¹ One of Quintus's two estates near Arpinum, the other
being Laterium.
