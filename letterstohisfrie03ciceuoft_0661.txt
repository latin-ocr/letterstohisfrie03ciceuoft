EPISTL‘LAE AD BRLTL‘M, 11.

Now l’ll warrant you are waiting for me to pay you
compliments on them. I cannot say whether these
pamphlets are a higher testimonial to your fine spirit
or to your wealth of genius. I readily grant you that
they should be dubbed “ Philippics,'’ if you like t that
is the title you jestingly gave them in one of your
letters.

W’e stand in want of two things, Cicero, money and 5
fresh drafts. The latter it is in your power to make
available ε you can send us a contingent from where
you are, either by a private understanding with
Pansa? or by proceedings in the Senate 3 the former
could come from the Senate directly. The need
for the former, which is just as great in the armies of
the other generals as in mine, makes me regret so
much the more the loss of Asia.²' I hear that Dola-
bella ⁶ is harrying it to such effect that his murder of
Trebonius no longer strikes me as his most fiendish
atrocity. All the same, Vetus Antistius ἆ has met
part of my needs with a money contribution.

Your son Cicero ⁶ gives me such a good account of 6
himself in respect of his enei-gy, power of endurance‚
application, high spirits, in a word, in every helpful
quality, that he seems never for a moment to lose out
of mind whose son he is. Therefore‚ seeing that I
cannot contrive to make you hold him in still higher
affection (for he is the apple of your eyes), I ask you,
in deference to my considered opinion, to assure your-
self that he will not need to poach on your renown in
order to attain his father’s high rank. Dyrrhachium,
April 1.
