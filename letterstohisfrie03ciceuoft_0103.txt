EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xn.-xxn.

at sicyona and were not informed that he is still
staying at Cibyra,¹’ where I left him, there would have
been no necessity for my writing to you about him
at any greater length. For I feel sure that he would
succeed by his own character and culture, unaided by
anybody’s recommendation, in winning your csteem
no less than mine, and that of all 1115 other intimate
friends.

But, believing him to be away, I commend to you 2
with more than customary earnestness his family
(they live in Sicyon) and his private property, and
particularly Gaius Avianius Hammonius, his freed-
man, whom I also commend to you 0111115 own account.
For not only has he won my approval by 1115 remark-
able sense of duty and loyalty to 1115 patron, but 116
1135 3150 conferred great obligations upon myself, and
in the days of my greatest trouble he stood by me as
faithfully and affectionately as though it were I who
had manumitted him. I therefore beg of you to give
that Hammonius not only your support in his patron's
business, as being the agent of the man I am recom-
mending to you, but also your regard on his own
account, and put him on the list of your friendS.
You will find him a modest and obliging person, and
worthy of your regard.
