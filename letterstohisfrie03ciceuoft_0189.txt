follows that it was a great pleasure to me to see him
at. Rome. For you cannot have failed to notice (you
who have shown generosity to such numbers ofpeople
in your province) what proportion of them are found
to be grateful.⁰
Ι have a double object in writing thus—so that 2

you may understand that I have good reason for
taking the trouble, and so that you yourself may
deem the man worthy of your hospitality. You will
therefore do me the greatest favour if you make it
manifest to him how highly you value me—in other
words, if you take him under your protection and
assist him in whatever way you can consistently with
your honour and convenience. That will give me
extreme pleasure. and I ask you again and again to
do so. ’

CICERO To HIS COLLEAGUE b Ρ. SERVILIUS, PROCONSUL

Rome, September, 46 κο.

Ι was exceedingly pleased with your letter which 1
gave me the routes of your various voyagings ; for
you implied thereby that you had not forgotten our
close association‚ which was the greatest joy of my
life. As to the future, it will give me even greater
pleasure if you write and tell me in a friendly way
all about public affairs,—in other words, about the
situation in your province, and the particulars of
your administration ; and although, celebrated man
as you are, I shall be told all this by many otherS, I
should like best of all to get the information out of
a letter from you.
