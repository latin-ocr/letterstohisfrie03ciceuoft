CICERO SENDS WARM GREETINGS TO TREBONIUS⁰
Rome, January (ζ’), 45 13.c.

I have entrusted my Orator (for I have so en· 1
titlcd it) to your servant Sabinus. Considering the
man's nationality, I could not help thinking that I
was right in doing so3 unless, of course, he too has
availed himself of the licence given to candidateS,
and suddenly seized upon this particular surname b ;
311(1 yet his modest expression of face and the calm-
ness of his speech seems to have something derived
from Cures ⁶ in it. But enough about Sabinus.

You, however, my dear Trebonius, since your de· 2
parture added no little fuel to the fire of my affection
for you, to enable me the more easily to endure the in-
tense ardency of mylonging for you,be sure you ply me
with a rapid succession of letters, on the understand-
ing that Ι shall do likewise. And yet there are two
reasons why you should perform that duty with more
regularity than I—firstly because in olden days it was
the custom for those who were at Rome to write about
the Republic to their friends in the provinces 3 now it
is for you to write to us, for the Republic is where you
are.‘⁷z Secondly, because while Ι can do you many
other services in your absence, I fail to see how you
can serve me in any other way than by writing letters.

But on all other matters you will write to me later. 3
Just now what I am anxious to know before anything

‘¹ In the person of Caesar, now in Spain. This establishes
the date of this letter.
