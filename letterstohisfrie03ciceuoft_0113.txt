EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxvl.

is heir to his cousin M. Mindius, who was a banker at
Elis) by means not only of your lawful powers but
also of your weighty influence and advice. For my
instructions to those to whom I entrusted those
business affairs were as follows: “that in anything
brought forward as admitting of any dispute they
should employ you to arbitrate, and (so 131· 35 11
could be done without inconveniencing you) to settle
the case once for all.'' This I press you again and
again to undertake to do in the interests 01 my honour.

This 100 15 another great favour you will do me, if 3
you do 1101 consider it incompatible with your position
—that if any 01 111050 001100111οᾶ 310 50 obstinately
intractable as 10 having 1110 matter settled without 3
trial, you should refer thern, 511100 3 senator 15 involved
in the case, 10 Rome.‘² And 10 enable you to do so
with 1110 1055 hesitation, I have in my hands a
despatch to you from the consul M. Lepidus,b 1101
5αο11 35 to lay any injunction upon you (that, I 0011-
sider, would be inconsistent with your position) but
which conveys in a sort 01 way what may be called 3
1000111111οη(1311011.

you would be likely to make in doing Mescinius this
favour, were not I sure that you are aware of it, and
were it not that this request 01 1111110 is really a selfish
one ; for Ι would have you believe that Ι am no less
anxious about his interests than he is himself. But
while I desire that he should come by his own with
the least possible difficulty, I am also anxious to give
him the impression that this recommendation of
mine has not been the most negligible factor in his
success.
