EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. 111.

a decree of the Senate was carried, “ that what had
been done on the 6th was against the interests of the
State.'' On that day Cato vehemently inveighed
against Pompey, and throughout his speech ar-
raigned him as though he were in the dock. Hc
spoke a great deal about me, much against my will,
though in highly laudatory terms. When he de-
nounced Pompey’s treacherous conduct to myself, he
was listened to amid profound silence on the part of
my ill-wishers.‘2 Pompey replicd to him in vehement
terms, and made an obvious allusion to Crassus,
openly declaring “ that he himself would be better
prepared to safeguard his own life than Africanus
had been, who was murdered by C. Carb0.'' b
So it appears to me that issues of great importance 4

are developing. For Pompey clearly understands
this, and talks to me about it—that plots are being
hatched against his life ; that C. Cato is being backed
up by Crassus ; that Clodius is being supplied with
money, and that both of them are being encouraged‚
not only by Crassus, but by Curio and Bibulus and
the rest of his detractors ; that he has to take strenu-
ous measures to prevent being utterly crushed, with
a speech-swallowing populace practically estranged
from him, with a nobility hostile, a Senate unfairly
prejudiced, and the youth of the country without
principle. So he is making preparations, and calling
up men from rural districts, while Clodius is strength·
ening his hired gangs. A regiment of them is being
trained for the Quirinalia, to meet which date we
are far superior in numbers, with Pompey's own
forces3 besides, a large contingent is expected from
Picenum and Gaul, so that we may also oppose
Cato’s motions about Milo and Lentulus,
