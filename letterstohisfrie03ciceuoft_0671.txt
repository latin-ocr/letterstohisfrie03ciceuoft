EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, v.

have always been the same as yours, Brutus3 my
way of thinking in certain matters (I do not say in all)
was perhaps a little more drastic. You know that it
was always my resolve that the state should be freed
not merely of a monarch but of monarchy. You took
a more lenient view, and this was altogether to your
undying credit 3 but which was the better policy we
have been made to feel to our bitter sorrow, and are
experiencing at our great peril. At that time, not
so long ago, your supreme goal was peace, which
could not be won by oratory3 mine was liberty,
which without peace is an illusion. I considered that
peace as well as liberty could be secured by force of
arms. The party that called for arms was thoroughly
in earnest ; yet we stifled their enthusiasm and
damped down their ardour.

Consequently things came to such a pass, that but 2
for that divine inspiration which came to Caesar
Octavianus,‘² we should have had to fall under the
power of that utter desperado, that foul wretch,
Marcus Antonius, and you can see what a struggle,
and how hard-fought, we have even now with him.
This conflict of course would be non—existent, if
Antony’s life had not then been spa1·ed.²' But Ι say
nothing of this, for your unforgcttable and almost
superhuman exploit disarms all criticism, indeed I
cannot even match it with really adequate words of
praise. In these last days you have asserted yourself
with a grim visage ; by your own effort you have in
a short time raised sufficient troops, supplies and
legions. Heavens, what a piece of news that wa&
what a bulletin! How gladdened was the Senatc,
and how elated the citizens l I never saw such
an unanimous expression of praise for anythiug.
