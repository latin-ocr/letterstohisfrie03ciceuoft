first century.“ The business is a blaze of scandal.
The candidates for the tribuneship, having agreed
to abide by arbitration, have deposited 500 sestertiab
apiece in the hands of M. Cato c—-they to canvass
according to his instructions, and any of them failing
to do so to be condemned by him. And if that elec-
tion proves free from all corruption, as it is supposed
it will, Cato will have proved himself more powerful
than all the laws and jurors put together.

CICERO TO QUINTUS IN GAUL
Rome, end of August, 54 13.c.

When you receive a letter from me in my secre-
tary's hand, you may be sure that I have not had even
a moment’s leisure 3 isin my own, that I have had
just a little. For you may take it from me that I
have never been more disti-acted by cases and trials,
and that in the most unhealthy season of the year, and
when the heat is most oppressive. But, since it is you
who so instruct me, I must put up with it all, and
never make the mistake of seeming to have dis-
appointed either the expectations or the ideas you
and Caesar have of me, especially since, however
difficult it may have proved, it is never-theless likely
that the result of my effort will be no little gain in
popularity and prestige. And so, as you would have
me do, I shall take every care not to hurt any-
one's feelings, but to win the esteem of even those
who resent my having become so closely attached to
Caesar, and the sincere respect and affection of those
who are impartial, or even inclined to our side.
