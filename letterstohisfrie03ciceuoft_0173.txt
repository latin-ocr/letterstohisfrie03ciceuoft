CICERO To CURTIUS PEDUCAEANUS,“ PRAETOR
Laodicea, February, 50 B.C.

I am exceptionally fond of M. Fadius⁶; I have
constant intercourse with him, and our intimacy is of
very long standing. In his various suits I make no
request as to your decisions (you will, as your credit
and position demand, observe your edict⁰ and your
established rule of administration) but this I do ask
you—-to let him have as easy access to you as is
possible, to grant him without reluctance such
requests as are right and proper, and to make him feel
that my friendship, even though I am far away, is of
service to him, especially with you. That is what I
beg of you again and again to do.
