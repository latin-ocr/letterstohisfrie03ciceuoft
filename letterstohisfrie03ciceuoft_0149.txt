were my own. To assist your memory, Ι should be
glad if you would send hima something in the shape of
a letter to be handed back to you in the province, but
please draw it up in such a way that, when you read
it, you can at once recall the care Ι have taken in
writing this recommendation. This I earnestly beg
of you again and again to do.

XLIV

CICERO TO QUINTIUS GALLUS
Rome, 53 (ἓ) 13.c.

Although your own letter and that of my very dear
friend L. Oppius have convinced me that you have
not been forgetful of my recommendation (and Ι am
not in the least surprised at that, considering your
extremely kind feeling for me and the closeness of
our connexion), still Ι commend to you again and
again L. Oppius, who is with you, and the affairs of
my very dear friend L. Egnatius, who is not. So
close is my connexion and intimacy with him that Ι
should not feel more anxious if the business were niv
own. That is why you will do me a very great favour
if you make a point of giving him reason to know that
your affection for me is as sincere as Ι myself believe
it. to be. Nothing that you can do would give me
greater pleasure‚ and Ι earnestly beg of you to do so.
