EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxlx.

our hereditary connexion, our mutual affection, our
common pursuits, and the close resemblance of our
whole lives throughout their course (and Ι could not
make this request with more solicitude and earnest·
ness than Ι do), to account the matter mine, to spare
no effort, no endeavour, and so to bring it about that
through my recommendation, your own assiduity,
and the kindness of Caesar, Capito may make good
his claim to his relative’s legacy. If Ι prevail upon
you to do this, I shall consider that you have be-
stowed upon me unasked all the favours Ι might
have prevailed upon you to grant me, had Ι but

and power.

I hope that this fact will be of assistance to you—
a fact of which Caesar himself can best judge——that
Capito has consistently respected and esteemed

know what a memory he has. I have therefore no
instructions to give you ; but in speaking to Caesar
on Capito's behalfyou must limit what you take upon
yourself to say to what you perceive to be within
Caesar's own recollection.

For my own part, I shall just lay before you what Ι ι
have been able to prove by persona] experience ; the
significance of it you will see for yourself. What side
and what cause I have always championed in polstics,
what individuals and what orders α in the State have
enabled me to hold my ground, and by whom I have
been protected—all that you know perfectly well.
Now I would have you take my word for this—that if
in this very war I did anything in the slightest degree
offensive to Caesar (and Ι was aware that Caesar him-
sels knew that I did so with the utmost reluctance)‚
