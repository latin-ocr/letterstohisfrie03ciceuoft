CICERO To QUINTUS (ΟΝ HIS wn' TO SARDINIA)

Rome, December, 57 B.C.

The letter you have just read I sent off this morn- 1
ing. But Licinius was so courteous as to visit me in
the evening after the dismissa] of the Seu-dte, so that,
if Ι thought good, I might write you a full account of
anything that had been done there. The Senate was
better attended than I thought possible in the month
of December so near the holidays. Of us consular-s
there were P. Servilius‚‘² M. Lucullus,⁶ Lepidus,c
Volcatius,c Glabrio,d the two consuls designate, and
the praetors. ἣτε made quite a full house, being
about 200 altogether. Lupus ⁶ had roused our
expectations. He discussed the question of the
Campaniam land with extreme particularity‚ and was
listened to in profound silence. You are well aware
what material it offers for a speech. He omitted

⁶ Publius Rutilius Lupus, who was strongly opposed to
Caesar's law for the division of the Campanian land.
