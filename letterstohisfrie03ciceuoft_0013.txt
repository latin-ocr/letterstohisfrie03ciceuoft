INTRODUCTION

Tms collection of Cicero's “ Letters to his Friends ’'
was preserved and edited by his secretary Tiro. The
collection is inadequately entitled, as it includes
several letters, some of them of profonnd interest,
from 1115 friends to Cicero There aie 126 letteis,
divide-d into sixteen books, not arranged in an3
sort of order,‘¹ chronological ol otherwise, except
that letters from or to pz 1111001111 correspondents are
generally grouped together3 the third book, for
instance, consists exclusively of letters from Cicero
to Appius Claudius Pulcher, and the eighth book of
letterS from Maleus Caelius Rufus to Cicero.

The earliest lette1 iS one from Cicero to, Pompey
(x 7) dated 62 B. C.‚ the 3ear af·te1 Cicero ’5 consul-
ship; the 111651 15 0116 fr 0111 him to Cassius (xii.10)
written in 43 ss.c., 1116 3 ear after the assassination of
Caesar, and a few months before his own.

These nineteen years from 62 to 43 B.c. cover a
period of supreme importance in the history of the
Roman Republic——a period more minutely described
and 3i3idly illustrated in these letters, gi3ing us as
they do the different pointS of 3ie33 of 3arious omre-
spondents, than even in the‘ ‘Letters to Atticusj'
written by Cicero alone.

‘⁸ The confusion thus caused is to some extent obviated
by a summary, in chronological order, prefixed to each
volume, of the events in each year covered by the Letters.
