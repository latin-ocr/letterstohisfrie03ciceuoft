EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIV. 11.

to look for help, to think that now, Terentia mine, you
are thus harassed, thus laid low in tcars and un-
seemly humiliation ! And to think that it is all my
fault, who have saved others to perish myself!

As to what you write about our house,⁰ or rather 3
its site, Ι assure you that I shall never feel myselffully
restored until that has been restored to me. These
things however are not in our handS. What dis-
tresses me is, that whatever expenditure has to be
incurred, you, in your unhappy and impoverished
circumstanceS‚ should be let in for part of it. Of
course, if the business of my restoration is carried
through, we shall get all we want ; but if we are to
be dogged by the same ill-fortune as heretofore, will
you, my poor wife, throw away the little that is left
to you ? Ι implore you, my darling, as far as expense
is concerned, to let others, who can if they only will,
bear the burden, and do not, as you love me, tax that
indifferent health of yours. Day and night you are
ever before my eyes. I see you taking upon your-
self all our troubles, and I fear it is too much for you.
But I also see that everything depends upon you3
and for that reason, in order that wc may succeed in
what you are hoping and striving for, obey thc
dictates of health.

I know not to whom I should write, unless it is to 4
those who write to me, or to those about whom you and
Tullia say anything in your letters to me. Since that
is your wish, Ι am not going farther away3 but I
should like you to send me a letter as often as
possible, especially if we have any better foundation
for our hopes. Good-bye‚ you dear ones for whom I
long, good-bye. Thessalonica, Oct. 5th.
