r·et1e·1t from It· aly to G allia N· z‘ubonensis (S. F.

At Rome it was at first assumed that the victorious
armies would pursue Antony and make short work of
him. But the deaths of Hirtius and Pansa, of whom
the former was killed in the action of Mutina, and the
latter died shortly afterwards of wounds, deprived
the coalition forces of their best leaders ; and
Octavian, the son of Caesar, refused to co-operate
with Decimus Brutus, his father's murderer. Antony
was thus able to extricate himself and to put pres-

Aemilius Lepidus, to join hands with him. Lepidus,
who had previously assured the Senate of his loyalty,
consented to put his powerful army at Antony’s dis—
posal ; and it was an insufficient offset to this success
of Antony that L. Munatius Plancus, governor of
Gallia Comata (Central and Northern France), re-
mained loyal to the Republic for the time being (till
July or August). Meanwhile Octavian show ed signs
of breaking with the Senate and coming to terms with
Antony. By midsumn1er‚43 B. c.‚ therefore, the
situation had become critical for the senatorial forces
in Italy, and the Senate' s only chance now lay m the
timely arrival of reinforcements from Marcus Brutus.

In August, 44 B.C.‚ M. Brutus and C. Cassius
ended a period of indecision, during which they had
wandered somewhat aimlessly about Italy, by betak-
ing themselves to the eastern provinces and ruis-ing
armies there on their own authority. By March,
43 B.C.‚ Cassius had rendered himself master of
Syria3 but he still had to reckon with opposition
from P. Cornelius Dolabella, Antony’s colleague in
