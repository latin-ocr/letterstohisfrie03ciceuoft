Athens, August or early in September, 44 13.c.

Although Ι was anxiously on the look out forl
your letter-carriers every day, they only came at
last forty-six days after they had left you, and
their arrival was most welcome to me. For though
my most kindly and well-beloved father’s epistle
gave me the greatest possible pleasure, still it was
your most delightful letter that crowned my joy.
So I no longer regret having made a break in my
correspondence, but rather rejoice at it3 for the
silence of my pen has brought me the rich reward

Brutus, who had made his acquaintance at Athens, made
him commander of a squadron of cavalry, in which capacity
he served with some credit against Antony. About this
time Cicero desired to see his son among the Pontifices, but
decided that he should not return to Italy unless accompanied
by Brutus 3 it thus fell out that he escaped the pmscription,
in which perished his father, his uncle, and his cousin. He
fought at Philippi in 42, and after that battle fied to Sextus
Pompeius, who made much of him. He returned to Rome in
39 and was handsomely treated by Octavian, who in 30
made him consul suffectum and it was while holding that
office that Marcus had the statues of Antony overthrown‚
and carried a decree that from that day no Antonius should
bear the name of Marcus. Thus it came to pass that, in the
words of Plutarch (Cic. 49), “ Heavcn (τὸ δαιμόνιον) delivered
over to the house of Cicero the final punishment of Antony.'’

Some years later Marcus became proconsul of Asia, and
afterwards leyatus of Syria.

Though he inherited some of his father's wit, Marcus was
a man of mediocre intellect and little ambition3 but that
he must have possessed considerable military and ad-
ministrative ability is proved by his fairly successful career.
