EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xlx.

Lyso had been on our side and under our aegis, wc
were in daily dread of something happening. His
own distinction, however, and the hearty support
of myself and his other friends of that type have
ended in our obtaining from Caesar all we wanted, as
indeed you will infer from Caesar's letter to you.

In this letter not only do I make no abatement in 2
the strength of my recommendation to you, as ifI had
now got all I wanted, but I press you all the more
earnestly to admit Lyso into your confidence and
intimacy. When his fortunes were in the balance, I
felt a little timid in pleading with you, fearing some—
thing so serious might happen that not even you
could rectify it3 but now that his civil status is
assured, Ι beg of you in all earnestness and solicitude
to carry out all my requestS. To avoid a detailed list
of thern, I commend to you his whole family, includ-
ing his young son, whom my client C. Maenius
Gemellus, when in the dark days of his exile he was
made a citizen of Patrae, adopted according to the
laws of that town ; I ask you to maintain the rights
of his cause in respect of that inheritance.

The main point is that you should admit Lys0, 3
whom I have found to be a most excellent and grateful
person, to your close intimacy. If you do so, I have
no doubt that, in making much of him and afterwards
recommending him to others, you will arrive at the
same opinion and conceive the same goodwill towards
him as Ι do. But intensely anxious as Ι am that this
should be done, I am at the same time afraid lest if
it appears that in some particular respect you have
failed to display a superabundance of energy on his
behalf, he may suspect me of not having written
warmly enough, and not you of having forgotten me.
