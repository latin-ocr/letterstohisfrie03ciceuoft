EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 11.

you deserved the smallest reproof in any respect, so
absolutely blameless was your conduct, were it not
that we had a multitude of enemies. W'hatever I
have written to you in a tone of admonition and re-
proof‚ that I have written on account of my anxious
watchfulness, which I maintain and ever shall main-
tain‚ and Ι shall never cease uiging you to do so also.

Attalus of Hypaepaa has pleaded 111111 1116 1113114

closely attached to us, to bc impaired or obstructed

There is, moreover, the case of Licinius, the slave of
Aesopus, the tragic actor,c and my friend 3 you know
the fellow; well, 116 1133 run away. He posed 33 3

and came from there into Asia. Later on one Plato
of Sardis, an Epicurean, who spends much of his time
at Athens, and happened to 116 there when Licinius
arrived, on learning by a subsequent letter from
Aesopus that he was a runaway slave, had the fellow
arrested and handed over into custody at Ephesus ;
but whether it was into a public prison or a private
mine I could not quite gather from his letter. In
whatever way it is possible, since he is now at
thesus, I should be glad if you would trace the 111311
