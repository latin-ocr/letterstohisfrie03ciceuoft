CICERO To M. BRUTUS

Rome, some time in 46 13.c.

Ῐ am on 'che most intimate terms with L. Titius 1
Strabo, an eminently honourable and distinguished
Roman knight. There is no bond of the closest
relationship that does not subsist between us. A
sum of money is owing to him 111 3our 1110111166 from
P. Cornelius. The praetor urbanus V oIcatlus α 1135
passed on the 6356 for tr‘ial 111 Gaul.

I beg of you 311 the more e 1111651117 than if the case 0
were my own, in propm tlon as it is more 3 point of
honour to take pains in the matter of one 's friends'
money than one ’5 own, to see to it that the business
is carried through. Take it on your own shoulderS,
settle it, and do what 3ou 6311 consistentl3 with what.
3ou deem right and proper, to ensure that Strabo' 5
freedman, who has been dispatched 101· the purpose,
may conclude the business on the most fawourable
terms possible, and get at- the 11101161. Not 01111 11111
that (1116 me the greatest pleasure, but you yourself
too 11111 find L. Titius full3 11 orthv of 3 our friendship.
That 3ou should interest yomseif m ’this mattel, 35
you generall3 do in e3 er3 thing 3ou kn033 to be my
wish, Ι earnestly beg of 3ou again and again.
