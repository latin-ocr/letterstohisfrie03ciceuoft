Although I doubt not, considering the deference

my recommendation in mind, yet I commend to you
again and again my dear friend, that same L. Oppius
who is with you, as also the business affairs of my
dear friend, L. Egnatius, who is not. So close is my
association and intimacy with him that Ι could not be
more anxious if it were my own affair. On that
account you will do me the greatest favour if you
make a point of giving him the impression that your
affection for me is as sincere as I myself believe it to
be. There is nothing you can do that would please me
more ; and so I earnestly beg of you to do it.

Rome, 53 13.c.

with whom I am on most intimate terms, and I wish
him every success, as indeed I am bound to do. It was
about him that I urgently pleaded with you in person,
when you replied to me with the utmost courtesy, and
in a previous letter to you I gave you full particulars ;
