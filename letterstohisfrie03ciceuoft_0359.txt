CICERO TO TIRO

Off Leucas, November 7, 50 13.c.

TulliuS. and Cicero, and the two Quinti, send
11 aimeSt greetings to that most kindly and best of
men, Tiro.

See what an attractive person you a.re V W e 11310 l
been two hours at shvi reum Xenoni eneS, my host,
is as fond of you as if he had been >oui life- -00111-
panion. He has promised to do ev erything that y ou
require, and I think he will do so. My xiew w ’15 that,
should you now be stronger, he should land you in
Leucas, so that you might get perfeetly well there.
You will see 11 hat are the views of CuriuS, of L) so,
and of y our doctor. I wanted to send Mario back to
you, 50 that when things are 3 little better with
you, you should send him to me ; but I reflected that
Mario could bring me but a single letter, while I
was looking forward to a budget.

You can therefore, and, if you love me, you
will arrange to have Acastus in attendance at the
harbour every day. There will be many to whom
you ean properly entrust 3 letter, and who would
deliver it to me with pleasure. For my own part
I shall not pass over anybody who is going to
Patrae. I put 311 my hopes of your being properly
attended to in Curius. Nothing 0311 be kinder or
more devoted to me than he is. Put yourself
entirely in his hands. Ι 113(1 rather see you well
3 little later on, than poorly in the immediate
present. Let your health be your only care:
