CICERO 'ro TERENTIA AND HIS FAMILY
Dyrrachium, Nov. aoth, 58 mc.

Aristocritus has handed me three letters which Ι l
have almost blotted out with my tears. I am over-
whelmed with grief, my dear Terentia, and I am not
more tortured by my own miseries, than by yours

my own downfall itself is common to both of us, the
fault is entirely my own. It was my duty either to
avoid danger by accepting the legatio? or to resist it
with what devotion and resources I could, or to fall
courageously. Nothing was more pitiful, more dis-
honourable, or more unworthy of myself than what
I did.

And that is why I am overcome not only by sorrow 2
but also by shame. I am ashamed of not having
given assurance of my courage and devotion to my
best of wives and my sweetest of children. Night
and day there flit before my eyes the mourning garb
and melancholy of all of you, and your own feeble
health, and slender indeed is any hope of recall that
Ι can see. My enemies are many, almost everybody
is jealous of me. To ej ect me was a big business, to
keep me out is easy. However‚ as long as you have
hope, I shall not salter, lest it should seem that
everything has happened ⁶ through my fault.

As to your anxiety that I should be personally safe,
that presents no difficulty at all to me just now,
when even my enemies wish me to go on living in
this hopeless misery. I shall act, however, according
