EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. 1.

Epicurus ; but Ι wrote nothing to you for the simple
reason that Ι did not want your scheme of building to
be interfered with by any recommendation of mine.
But when he also asked me, on my arrival at Athens,
to write to you to the same effect, he had his request
granted to him for no other reason than because your
friends were unanimously agreed that you had thrown
to the winds all that building scheme of yours.

If that is so, and it is now of absolutely no im- 4
portance to you, I should like you, if your feelings
have been ever so slightly hurt by the wrong-headed-
ness of certain persons (I know that coterie a), to
allow yourself to incline towards leniency, whether
because of your own exceptional kindliness, or even as
a compliment to myself.

For my part, if you ask me what my own opinion
is, I fail to see either why he is so obstinately set
upon it, or why you are so stoutly opposing him,
except, of course, that one could far less easily allow
yon than him to be so needlessly troubled.b

And yet I am well aware that you know all about
Patro’s petition and the merits of his case. He avers
that he must keep intact his own honour and respon-
sibility, the sanctity of testamentary dispositions‚
the authority of Epicurus, the solemn injunction of
Phaedrus, the residence, the domicile, the very foot-
prints of the most illustrious men. If we are inclined
to find fault with the object of his present effortS‚ we
may as well make mock of the poor fellow's whole
life and the principles he follows in philosophy.
But, on my oath, since I bear no particular grudge
against the great man and those others who are
fascinated by ¹such doctrines, Ι think perhaps that we
ought to forgive Patro, if he is so much troubled;
