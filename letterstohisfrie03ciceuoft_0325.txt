EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. xv.

perhaps more bound to justify it to you, than to
expect such justification from y.ou And y‚et as Ι
frequently remind my self, my observations to you
and yours to me in our friendly talks led us both to
this conclusion—we thought it 1ight and proper that,
if not the whole quari el at any rate curjudgment of
it, should be determincd by the issue of a single
battle. And not a soul has ever rightly found fault
with this opinion of ours, except those who think it
better that the commonw ealth should be utterly
destroyed than survive in an impaired and enfeebled
condition. Ι, on the cont1a1y pictured to my self
no hope of course in its destruction, much in any
remnants that were left.

But the events which followed were such that it is 2
more of a surprise that they could have happened at
all, than that we should not have seen them coming
and have failed, being but human, to prognosticate
them. For my part I confess that what Ι conjectured
was this—I thought that after the great battle,
fraught as it were with the issues of fate, had been
fought, the victors would desire measures to be taken
in the interests of the cornmunity, and the vanquished
in their own ; ‘² but I held that both the former and
the latter depended upon the promptitude with
which the victor acted. Had he shown that prompti-
tude, Africa would have experienced the same
leniency as was witnessed by Asia, yes, and by Achaia
too, you yourself, as I take it, being their emissary
and intercessor.b But those days of vital importance,
especially in civil wars, having been wasted‚ the year
that intervened tempted some to hope for victory,
others to think lightly of defeat itself. And the
blame for all these evils is on the shoulders of fortune.
