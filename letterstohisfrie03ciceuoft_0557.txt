EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, II. xm.

CICERO 'ro QUINTUS IN THE COUNTRY
Rome, February 14, 54 ac.

Your “ black snow ’' tickled me, and I am highly l
delighted that you are in a merry mood which
prompts you to joke. As to Pompey, I quite agree
with you, or rather you agree with me. For, as you
are aware, I have long been singing the praises of
your friend Caesar. Believe me, he is my bosom
friend, and I never try to unbind “ the hoops of
steel.''

Now let me tell you about the Ides. It was 2
Caelius’s tenth day.a Domitius⁶ failed to get the
requisite number of jurors. I am afraid that abomin-
able and ruffianly fellow, Pola Servius,c will turn up
for the prosecution. For our friend Caelius is being
bitterly attacked by the Clodian family. There is
nothing certain so far3 but I am apprehensive. On the
same day then the Syrians were granted a full Senate;
on the other side the publicani of Syria appeared in full
force. Gabiniusd was fiercely abused3 but the publicani
on the other hand were denounced by Domitius for
having (as he said) honoured Gabinius with an escort
of cavalry. When Domitius said: “It is all your
fault, Knights of Rome, that this happened, since
your verdicts are lax,” our friend L. Lamia e rather
too impetuously rejoined: ‘⁴ Yes, they are our ver-
dicts, but it is you senators who vouch for a man’s
character.’' On that day nothing was done, and
night broke off the discussion.
