EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIV. 1.

my brother Quintus,a Ι make no charge against you,
but it has ever been my wish that all of you, especi-
ally as there are so few of you, should be as closely
united as possible.

Ι have thanked those whom you wished me to 5
thank, and have written that you were my informant.
You tell me, my dear Terentia, that you intend
selling your house-property3 in that case, what, I
implore you (I am sadly worried about it), what is
going to happen? And if we are dogged by the
same ill-fortune, what will become of our poor boy ?
I cannot write what remains to be written, so irrepress-
ible are my tears, and I would not make you too
weep as bitterly. This much I do write—that if our
friends remain loyal, money will be forthcoming ; if
they do not, your own money will not enable you to
do what you want. In the name of our own pitiful
missortunes, beware lest we ruin our already ruined
boy. With something to stave off actual want, all
he needs to attain everything else is a fair share of
merit, and a fair share of luek.

Be sure you keep well, and send me letter-carriers 6
to let me know what is being done, and how you all
are. In any case I have not now long to wait. Give
my love to my dearest Tullia and Cicero. Good-bye.
Dyrrachium, Nov. 25th.

I have come to Dyrrachium, because it is not only 7
a free state, but devoted to me, and is also the
nearest point to Italy. But if the place is too
crowded for my liking, I shall betake myself else-
where, and send you word.
