EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. vla.

with exceptional earnestness to recommend to you
with the utmost possible particularity one L. Julius.
I hardly think Ι can satisfy his eagerness by using
such words as I usually do, even when dealing with
anything most impressively. He insists upon some-
thing out of the common, and imagines that I possess
a certain artistry in that style. well, I have promised
him to fetch up from the depths of my art a style of
recommendation that will amaze him. Being unable
to reach that standard, I should be glad if you would
so act as to give him the impression that the effect of
{py- sftyle of letter has been something beyond all
e ie .

This you will do if you exhibit every form of 4
generosity which your kindness of heart and your
official opportunities can suggest, not only in deed
but also in word, and, let me add, even in look. How
important these things are in a province, Ι only wish
you knew by experience—I have an inkling, how-
ever, that you soon will.<² ’

As to the subject of my recommendation himself,
I believe him to be thoroughly worthy of your
friendship, not only because Cuspius tells me so
(though that ought to be enough), but also because
I know Cuspius's shrewdness in estimating men and
choosing his friends.

What effect this letter has produced I shall be able 5
to judge at an early date, and Ι feel sure I shall have
to thank you. For my part, I shall attend with zeal
and assiduity to whatever I think that you desire, or
that effects your interests. Mind you keep well.
