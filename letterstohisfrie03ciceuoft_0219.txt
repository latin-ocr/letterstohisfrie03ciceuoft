EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIV. 11.

CICERO TO TERENTIA AND HIS FAMILY

Thessalonica, Oct. 5, 58 B.c.

You must never think that Ι write longer letters to 1
anybody unless somebody has written to me at un-
usual length, and I think it my duty to answer him.
For Ι don’t know what to write, and just now there is
nothing I find greater difficulty in doing. But to
you and our darling Tullia Ι cannot write without a
flood of tears I see that both of you are utterly
wretched, you, whom I have always wished to be

completely happy— —a happiness it was my duty to
have secured, and I should have secured it, had I not
been so timorous.

For our friend Ρῐεοα Ι have a profound affection, 2
auditis no more than he deserves. I have done my
best to urge him on by letter, ancl have thanked him
as I was bound to do. I gather that you have hopes of
the new tribunes of the plebs. On that we may rely,
if we can rely on Pompey' s friendliness; and yet I
have my fears of Crassus. As sor yourself, I see that
you are acting in every respect most courageously
and lovineg, nor does it suiprise me3 but what
saddens me is the nature of a calamity in which my
own miseries can only be alleviated at the cost of
such miser-ies to you. For that most obliging of
men, P. Valerius, had described in a letter to me (and
l wept bitterly as 1 read it) how you w ere haled from
the temple of Vesta ὖ to the Valerian Office. ⁰ Alas‚

light of my life, for whom I yearn‚ to whom all used

a bank, she must have gone there io borrow money, though
this is inconsistent with ducta esses.
