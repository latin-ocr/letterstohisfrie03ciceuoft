indeed, as far as you are concerned, both I and all my
friends are abundantly satisfied with what you doss'

But Ι would really have 3ou believe that this2
family. and these members ofit‚ are vei-3 closely bound
to me by long r-stancling friendship, and mutual services,

more &than ordinary earnestness to do all 3ou can
for them in e3 er3 possible 33 ay, so fai as 3 0111 honour

and position permit. If 3ou do so, I shall be ex-
tremely grateful.
