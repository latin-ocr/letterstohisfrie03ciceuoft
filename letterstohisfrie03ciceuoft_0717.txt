EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xv111.

were cut up and himself driven off. After that
Brutus committed so many blunders that victory, as
it were, slipped out of his grasp. Our leaders failed
to pursue a demoralized, disarmed and badly mauled
army, and time was given to Lepidus to exhibit that
fickleness of his, which has often shown through in

sengers, to reckon with complete certainty on a
consulship. As soon as Ι became aware of this, I
neither ceased to send him warning letters in his
absence, nor to upbraid to their face his intimates
who appeared to be pandering to his greed, and in
the Senate I never hesitated to disclose the sources
of those most crimina} suggestions. And yet, to be
sure, I cannot remember on any occasion a more
patriotic Senate or boards of magistrates ; for it has

being claimed by a powerful, or rather by an over—
whelmingly strong personage α (for to be sure power
now rests on physical force and armed might), that
not a tribune of the plebs, not a magistrate of any
other rank, not a private member came forward with
a motion to that effect. But in the face of this firm-
ness and manly bearing the citizens felt none the less
uneasy ; for, Brutus, the troops with their fastidious
attitude and the general with his brazen demands,
both of them are making play with us. Every man
