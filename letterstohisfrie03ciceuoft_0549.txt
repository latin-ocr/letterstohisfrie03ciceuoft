than Philoctetes, b who having suffered wrong, desired
to see such sig hts as, I peiceive, are painsul to 3ou.

Ι entreat you, 11 ing 3 our u ay here. I shall comfort
you and uipe all sorrow from 3 our e3 65; 31111, 35 3 ou

CICERO TO QUINTUS IN SOME SUBURBAN RESIDENCE

Rome, February 10 01· ll, 54 13.c.

This letter has been elicited by the strong and im- l
portunate language of 30ur note. ⁶ As to the actual
