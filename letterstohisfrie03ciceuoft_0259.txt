EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV.

Cato, however, did not oppose, though he refrained
from voting for, a supplicatio to Cicero ; on the other
hand, he secured a supplicatio of greater length
(20 days) for his own incapable and worthless son-
in-law‚ M. Calpurnius Bibulus, Governor of Syria,
who (according to Cicero) ‘⁴ never stirred out of the
well-fortified and well-provisioned town of Antioch
during the whole time the Parthians were in his
province.'' It was this, as Dr. Strachan Davidson
remarks, even more than his failure to obtain a
triumph, that roused Cicero’s resentment and in-

dignation.
