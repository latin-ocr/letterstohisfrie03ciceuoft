EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. menn.

LXXIII

CICERO To Q. PHILIPPUS,“ PROCONSUL

Year uncertain.

I congratulate you on your safe return from your l
province with your reputation unimpaired and the
commonwealth intact. But had I seen you at Rome,
I should have thanked you in person for having
shown a kindly interest in my very intimate friend,
L. Egnatius,b who was not on the spot, and in L.
Oppius, who was.

With Antipater of Derbe ⁶ I have ties not only of 2
mutual hospitality but also of the closest intimacy. I
am told that you have been exceedingly angry with
him, and it distressed me. As for the facts, I am not
in a position to pass any judgment, but of this Ι am
very sure, that being the man you are, you have done
nothing without due consideration. Any how, in xiew
of our long- -standing association, I beg of you again
and again, as a special fax our to myself, to refrain
from taking any action against his sons, uho are at
your mercy —unless of course you think that to do
so involv es an outrage upon your reputation. If Ι
thought so, I should never make this request, and
your fair name would w eigh far more uith me than
the association I have mentioned. But Ι try to
persuade my self (it is possible that I may be mis-
taken) that your doing so will prove a credit to you
rather than a handle for abuse.

As to what can be done, and what you can do for
me (of your willingness Ι have no doubt), I should
like you, if it will be no trouble to you, to send me
word.
