EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. nux-xxv.

Ι express my gratitude to you that my letter has
had such influence with you that on perusing it you
put away from you all the feeling of offence caused
by the suspicion you entertained of Lyso ; and
secondly Ι would have you believe me when I
asseverate that Ι am writing this not more on Lyso’s
than on every other man's behalf—that there is no
man alive who has ever mentioned your name without
praising you up to the skies. As for Lyso, when he
was in my company almost every day and lived with
me, he used to praise in my presence your every word
and deed—-not only because it was a pleasure to me
to listen‚ but because it was an even greater pleasure
to him to say so.

For that reason, although he is being so treated by 3
you that he no longer desires any recommendation of
mine, and imagines that my single letter has enabled
him to get all he wants, yet Ι beg of you with more
thanrusual earnestness to show your appreciation of
him by your kind services and generosity. I should
write and tell you what sort of a man he is, as Ι did
in previous letters, were I not convinced that he is by
this time sufficiently well known to you on his own
account.
