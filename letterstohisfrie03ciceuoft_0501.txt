EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, Ι. 111.

you will keep dark for fear they do you some injury.
You must beware particularly of this—and with that
object Ι think you should get Pomponius to help
you to make love to Hortensius himself—that your
authorship of that epigram about the Lea: Aurelia ‘¹
which was attributed to you when you were a candi-
date for the quaestorship, is not established by some
false testimony. There is nothing Ι fear so much as
this, that when people realize how much compassion
for me is likely to be excited by your supplications
combined with your acquittal, they will attack you all
the more fiercely.

Ι imagine that Messala b is devoted to you ; 9
Pompey is even now, I suspect, merely affecting to be
so. But may you never have to test the truth of all
this 1 Ι should pray to the gods for that, had they
not ceased to listen to any prayers of mine. How-
ever, Ι do pray that they may rest content with these
endless calamities of ours—calamities in which, after
all, not only is there no dishonouring taint of wrong-
doing, but in which is concentrated all that there is of
anguish, since what was done for the best has been
visited with the heaviest penalty.

As to my daughter (who is yours), and my little 10
Cicero, why should I commend them to you, my own
brother? Not but that I grieve that their bereavement
willcause you no less sorrow than myself. But, as long
as you are safe‚they will not be bereft. As for whatre-
mains to be said, as surely as I hope for some measure
of restitution, and the chance of ending my days in
my fatherland‚ so surely am I not allowed to write it
by my tears. Terentia also I would have you protect,
and pray reply to me on every point. Be as brave as
the nature of the case permits. Thessalonica, June 13.
