EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM. I. 11.

felt myself3 and how sinister and general that talk
was, Statius on his arrival discovered sor himself. In
fact he came in when some people were complaining
at my house about that very thing, and could not but
feel that the malevolent were venting their obloquy
upon himselfin particular.

But as to what used to aggravate me most when 3

self in conversation with me has used with the utmost
na‘z'vele' such expressions as “ I could not agree to that,''
“l lectured kim‚’' “I argued with him,’' “I cautiones]
him '' ? And although all this only proves how per-
fectly honest he is (and I quite believe it, since that is
what you think), still the mere appearance osa freed-
man or slave possessing such influence cannot fail to be

that certain persons were angry with you for your
strictness‚ but that this man's manumission gave
those who were angry plenty to tall< about.

by L. Caesius (a man whom Ι shall never in any
circumstances cease to serve, since l understood that

to you, though he had most undoubtedly murdered
