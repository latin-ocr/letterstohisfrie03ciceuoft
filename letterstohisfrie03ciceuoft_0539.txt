to—morrow Ι intend to be at Laterium,⁰ and from
there, after spending five days in Arpinum, to visit
my Pompeian house, having a peep at my Cuman villa
on my return, so that (since Milo's trial has been
fixed for May 7) Ι may be at Rome on the 6th, and
see you, my dearest and sweetest of brothers, I hope,
on that day. I thought it best that the building
operations at Arcanum ‘² should be held up until you
return. Make a point of keeping well, my dear
brother, and of joining me as soon as possible.
