EPIs'l'ULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. 11.

Ηο11·61·61· Ι do not want you to be anxious. I shall
exercise every kind of cantion.

In the matter of the Alexandrine king‚⁰ a decree 3
of the Senate has been passed to the effect that his
restoration by the employnient of ‘⁴ a host of men ''
seems fraught with danger to the commonwealth. In
what remained to be discussed in the Senate—the
question whether 116 should be restored by Lentulus
or Pompey—it seemed that Lentulus was making
good his case, a case in which I was amazingly
successful in discharging my obligations to Lentulus,
and brilliantly so in satisfying the wishes of Pompey
—but Lentulus’s case was proti-acted by the spiteful
obstruction of his detractor-s. Then followed the
comitial days, during which a meeting of the Senate
could not be held. What result the ruffianly conduct
of the tribunes will have, Ι 63111101 predict3 anyhow
I suspect Caninius will force his bill through hy
violence. In 311 this Ι have no clear idea as to what
Poinpey wants; what his particular friends desire,
nobody can fail to see. Those who are financing the
king make no secret of supplying sums of money to
fight Lentulus. It is beyond doubt that the business
seems to have been taken out of Lentulus's handS,
and it is 3 great grief to me. And yet he has done
many things for which I might be justly angry with
111111,ὸ were such 3 thing conceivable. If it suits
your interests‚ I should like you to take ship when
the weather is fair and settled, and join me as soon
as possible. For there are numberless things in
which I miss you daily in all sorts of ways. Your
people and mine are well. J anuary 17.
