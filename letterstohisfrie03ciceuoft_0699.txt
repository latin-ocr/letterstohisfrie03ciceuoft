EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xm.

that his personal enemies have originated or rather
transmitted to you some piece of news, so as to make
you less well-disposed to him. It is not my habit,
my dear Brutus—and Ι think you need not be told
so-—to make haphazard assertions about another
man : the hidden motives of men and their complex
natures make that a rash proceedingg but Clodius’
mind I have probed and tried and weighed up judici-
ally. There are many revelations of it, but these
need not be set doun on paper, for Ι want you to
take this as a formal deposition rather than a letter
of recommendation. He has obtained promotion by
favour of Antony‚ and Antony’s favour was actually
inspired in large measure by you. So he would like
Antony to come to no harm‚ provided that we suffer
none.

But he realizes (for he is, as you know, anything but 2
dull-witted) that it has come to this, that both parties
cannot be secure. For this reason he prefers us to be
so‚indeed his remarks and his feelings in regard to you
are most friendly. Therefore if anyone has repre·
sented him otherwise to you in a letter or in con-
versation, I beg you insistently to take my word in
preference, seeing that I have better means ofjudging
than his traducer (whoever he may be), and I have a
greater affection for you. Let Clodius rank in your
esteem as a very good friend and as a citizen of such
worth as his ample good sense and his abundant

fortune ought to make him,
