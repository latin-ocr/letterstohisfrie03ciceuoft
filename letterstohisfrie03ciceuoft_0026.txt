CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY

§¹7. Clodius’s turbulence in 56-57 had estranged
Pompey, who now leaned to the side of Milo, but
the extreme optimates (including M. Cato, who
was indebted to Clodius for a commission to settle
the affairs of Cyprus in 58) showed such fulsome
partiality for Clodius, that Cicero, being earnestly
requested by Caesar, whom he could not now dis-
obey, to undertake the defence of Vatinius, whom
he particularly detested, adroitly eonverted his pre-
dicament into a means of annoying the optimates
saying that‘ ‘if they coquetted with one Publius (viz.
Clodius), he would coquet with another Publius (viz.
Vatinius) by way of reprisal'’ (i. 9. 19).
