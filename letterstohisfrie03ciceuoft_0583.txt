EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. 1.

II . From that spotI proceeded straight along the via 3
l''itularia‘² to your Fufidian estate, which we purchased
for you in the last few weeks from Fufidius for 100,000
sesterces b at Arpinum. A more shady spot in summer
Ι never saw, water also gushing out in lots of places,
and a plentiful supply of it too. To put it shortly,
Caesius thought that you would have no difficulty in
irrigating fifty jngera⁰ of meadow land. lor my
part, I can assure you of this, and it is a matter I
know more about, that y ou will haze a marvellously
charming villa to live in, with the addition of a fish-
pond with ιγ’(εέε d'eazc, an exercising—ground, and a
plantation of vines ready staked. I am told that
you wish to retain this Bovillan estate. ἆ You will
yourself decide to do what you think best about
it. Cascellius often told me that even if the water
were taken away, and the right of drawing it were
established, and a servitude imposed on that estate,
we could still keep our price, if we desii-ed to sell it!
Ι have had Mescidius with me. He said that he had
agreed with you to do the work for three sesterces a
foot, and that he had paced the ground and found
it to be 3000 paces. I should have thought it more.
But I will guarantee that nowhere would the money
be spent more profitably. I had summoned Cillo
from Venafrum; but on that very day four of his
fellow-workmen and pupils had been crushed by the
falling in of a tunnel at Venafrum.

OnSeptember 13 Ι was at Laterium! I thorough- 4
ly examined the road, which pleased me so much

he used the water) a ius aquae ducendae, and imposing on

the servient estate the obligation to allow the water to be so

taken.” Roby, Classical Review‚ i. 67, quoted by Tyrrell.
