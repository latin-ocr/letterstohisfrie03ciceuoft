EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. 1.

nothing of the measures Ι had taken. There were
some stinging references to C. Caesar, some abuse
of Gellius,⁰ some remonstrances with the absent
Pompey. As he was late in bringing his speech to a
conclusion, he said he would not ask for our votes, for
fear of burdening us with a personal wrangle. Hc
said that he clearly inferred the feelings of the Senate
from the loud protests of earlier days and its present
silence. He proceeds at once to dismiss the Senate‚
when Marcellinusb says, “ You must not judge
by our silence, Lupus, what we approve, or do not
approve, at the present moment. As far as I am con-
cerned, and I think it is the case with the rest of us,
my reason for not speaking is, that I do not consider
it right and proper that the question of the Cam-
panianland should be discussed in Pompey’s absence. ’'
Then Lupus said that he had no further business for
the Senate.

Racilius ⁰ got up and began to raise the question of 2
the proposed prosecutions. Marcellinus was of course
the first he called upond3 and he, after seriously
protesting against the hurnings, killings, and stonings
of Clodius, proposed a resolution “that the praetor
urbanus should himself θ draw the lots for the jury,
that the elections should not be held until after the
allotrnent of the jurors, and that whoever obstructed
the trials would be acting against the common-
wealth.'' The proposal having met with hearty
approval, C. Cato s spoke against it, and so did
Cassius,⁹ the Senate loudly protesting when he gave
the elections precedence in time over the trials.
Philippus agreed with Lentulus!²

⁹ A tribune.
Ι ie.. Marcellinus, the consul designate.
