EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, 1v.-V.

You say that you wrote to your sister and your 5
mother, not to make known the successes of Cassius
before I thought proper. I see you were afraid, as
you had a right to be, lest the Caesarian party, which
is the name still being given to that body, should be
badly upset. But before we received your note the
story was out and had become common property, ·
your own couriers too had deliv ei ed correspondeme
to many acquaintances of yourS. To suppress the
news was therefore false policy‚ especiall3 as th· at w is
not practicable; and we thought that, supposing it
were possible, we should all othe same publish it
rather than keep it dark.

As for my son Cicero, if there is as much in him as 6
you tell me, I am of course as glad as I should be;
or again, if your fondness for him makes 3ou exagger-
ate, 3our very excess gives me immense pleasure at
the thought that you are his good friend.

story. My special duty is to inform you of my
impressions about the general condition of this
war, of my considered opinion and my personal
feeling on it. My ideals on the main political issue
