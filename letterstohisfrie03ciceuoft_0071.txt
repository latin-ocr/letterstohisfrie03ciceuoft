EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. lx.

mendation‚ but also because that was your own
inclination‚ you were anxious to accommodate that
company in any way you could, still when those
whose interests are in question thought it of para-
mount importance to them that I should make it
plain to you by letter also how I felt towards thern, I
have not hesitated to mite to you as I do.

I would have you believe that while it has always 2
been the greatest pleasure to me to make much of
the order ofpublicani as a w,hole and, considering the
great services that order has rendered me, it has been
my duty to do so, I am in a special sense a friend
to this Bithynian company—a company which by
the very fact of its connexions with the order in
general, and owing to the class of men of whom it is
composed, made up as it 1s ofrnembers of all the other
companies, constitutes a most important factor 1n the
State· ‚ and, as it happens, a large proportion of it
are on very intimate terms with myself‚ especially
the man who at this moment occupies the position
of its chief, P. Rutilius to wit. son of Publius
of the Menenian tribe, who is director⁶⁸ of that
company.

Such being the case, I entreat you with more than 3
usual urgency to support 11 ith every kindness and all
y·ou1 geneiosity Cn. Pupius, 11 ho is in the company ’s
employ‚ and to see to it that his services (you will
find it easy to do so) are as acceptable as possible to
the partners, and to show your desire (and how
much it is in the power of a quaestor to effect in that
connexion,I am well aware) that the property and
interests of those partners should prove to have been
protected and enhanced as far as possible by your
efforts.
