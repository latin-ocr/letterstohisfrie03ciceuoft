CICERO TO TERENTIA
Brundisium, June end, 47 13.c.

If you are in good heasth, all is well ; so am I. 1
would have you pay most particular attention to your
health 3 for I have been told both by letter and word
of mouth that you have had a sudden attack of fever.
You did me a kindness in informing me so quickly of
Caesar’s letter. From now on also, if there be any
need, if anything new has occurred, you will please
see that I am apprised ofit. Take care to keep well.
Good-bye. June end.

CICERO 'ro TERENTIA
Brundisium, probably Dec. 17 th, 48 mo.

To all my other woes must now be added the sorrow
caused me by the ill-health of Dolabella and Tullia.
Looking all round at everything‚ I don't know in the
world what steps to take, or what to do. Please take
care of your own and Tullia’s health. Good-bye.
