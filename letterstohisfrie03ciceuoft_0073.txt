CICERO 'ro M. vams BRUTUSa

Rome, earl3 in 46 13.c.

XVhen your quaestor, M. Varro, b was setting out to l
join 3ou‚ I did not think he lequired a recommenda-
tion. Ι considered him sufficiently recommended by
the practice of our ancestors‚ which assumed that a
quaestor’s connexion with his chief closely approxi-
mated to that of 3 son to his father. But since he had
convinced himself that 3 carefully written letter from
me would carry the greatest weight with you and
pressed me to write-with the utmost particularity, I
thought it better to do what my friend imagined to be
of so much importance to him.

To prove to you therefore that it is my duty to do 2
this, from the moment M. Terentius entered the
forum ⁶ he devoted himself to winning my friendship ;
afterwards, when he had established himself, Ι found
two additional reasons for feeling more warmly dis-
posed towards him3 one was that he took up the
same pursuit as myself-—that which even now gives
me most delight—and that with ability, 35 you know,
and with considerable industry ; the other was that at
an early stage he attached himself to the companies

⁰ i.e.‚ began to practise in the law—courts.
