blessed too with those tastes in literature and learn-

Ι beg of you then to recognize that, whether he is 2
on the spot or has not yet arrived in Sicily, the man is
among my most intimate and closest associates‚ and
so to treat him as to give him reason to believe that
my recommendation has been of material assistance

to him.

'CICERO TO MANIUS ACILIUS GLABRIO, PROCONSUL
Rome (?)‚ 45 13.c.

I am on very familiar terms with C. Flavius? an l
honourable and distinguished Roman knight3 for he
was a very intimate friend of my son—in-law‚ C. Ρίεο,ὸ
and both he himself and his brother L. Flavius
show me most marked respect. For that reason
I should like you, as a compliment to myself, to treat
C. Flavius in the most eomplimentary and generous
manner possible, in whatever lespect you can do so
without prejudice to y oui· honour and position. T hat
will give me more pleasuie than anything you could
possibl3 do.

But I further assure 3ou (and this I do impelled by 2
no interested motive, but by our close intimacy and
friendship, and even by truth itself) that C. Flavius’s
obliging and respectful demeanour, and moreover his
distinction and popularity among his own friends, will
be a source of great pleasure to you.
