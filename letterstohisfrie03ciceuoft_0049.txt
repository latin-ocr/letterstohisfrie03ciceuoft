CICERO TO Q. VALERIUS ORCAa
Rome, autumn, 45 ΒΩ.

M. T. Cicero warmly greets Q. Valerius Orca, son
of Quintus, legate with rank of Praetor.

I have the closest possible connexion with thel
townsmen of Volaterrae. Having received some con-
siderable kindness at my hands, they have proved
their gratitude to me in over-flowing measure3 for
never once have they failed me either in my triumphs
or in my troubles, And indeed, had no such relations
been in existence between us, nevertheless, in view
of my own warin affection for you and my apprecia-
tion of your very high esteem for me, I should both
advise and exhort you to promote their best interests,
especially as their claim to have their rights main-
tained is practically paramount‚ first because by the
mercy of heaven they succecded in escaping the
barbarities of the days of Sulla‚¹² and secondly be-
cause my defence of them in my consulship was
enthusiastically applauded by the people of Rome.

For when the tribunes of the plebs ⁶ proposed a 2
most iniquitous law about their lands, l had no diffi-
culty in persuading the Senate and people of Rome
to be willing that those citizens, whom fortune had
spared, should retain their rights. This policy of mine
was heartily approved in the land-law of his first
consulship by C. Caesar,0l who freed the district and

refused to recognize the deprivation of citizenship, and the
lands were never confiscateds Watson and Tyrrell.

⁰ Rullus and Flavius.

α Caesar would favour the Volaterrans as representing the
proscribed Marians. ’
