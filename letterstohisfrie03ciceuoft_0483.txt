heir, until they had paid a certain sum of 1noney to
C. F undanius; and that you had written in similar
terms to the people of Apollonis‚‘¹ telling them not to
allow any deductiori to be made from the estate of the
late L. Octavius Naso until a debt had been paid to
Fundanius. This does not seem to me to be at all

sure, do all you can in the interests of l lavius, and of
course of Pompey. On my word of honour, Ι have
no desire that 3ou should think me generous to him
at the cost of any injustiee on 3our part; but this I
do ask of you, that 3ou should 3 ourself 16336 behind
