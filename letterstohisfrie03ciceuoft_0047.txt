EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. 11.—111.

CICERO To MEMMIUS

Laodicea, May (ἓ), 50 mc.

1 am on intimate terms with C. Avianius Evander ⁰
himself, who is lodging in your family shrine,⁶ and
very much so with his patron M. Aemilius. I there—
for beg of you, with more earnestness than usual,
so far as it can be done without inconvenience to
yourself, to accommodate him in the matter of his
residence. For he has so many commissions on hand
for a number of people that it would hurry him to
have to move to his old quarters on July 1. My
modesty prevents me from preferring my request at
greater length, and yet I doubt not that, if it makes
little or no difference to you, you will be as obliging
as I should be, were you to make any request os me.
At any rate you will have done me a great favour.

c1CERO To MEMMIUS
Laodicea, 50 13.c.

A. Fufius,⁶ one of my most intimate friends, shows
me the greatest deference and devotion. He is an
aceomplished man and exceedingly kind-hearted, and
in every way worthy of your friendship. I should be
glad if you would treat him as you promised to do
when we met. That will give me as much pleasure
as anything in the world. You will besides bind the
man himself to you for ever by the strongest ties of
obligation and respect.
