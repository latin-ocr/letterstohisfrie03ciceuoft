EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. Lxx-tw.

your existing friendship for him—of that, as he has
often told me, he has no doubt—but also of the
enhancement of that friendship by this letter of mine.
In the whole sphere of your official authority and
of your province there is nothing you can do that
would give me more pleasure. And now Ido not
think you ean doubt how profitably you will be
investing your cordia] kindncss in one who is himselfa
most grateful fellow and a very excellent man.

CICERO TO Q. MINUCIUS THERMUS, PROPRAETOR
Cilicia, probably late in 51 n.c.

Cluvius of Puteoli α is exceedingly devoted to me
and exceedingly intimate with me. He is under the
conviction that he will have to reckon as lost and
hopeless whatever interests he has in your province,
unless he secures them through a commendatory
letter from me, while you are governor of the province.
Just now then, having so heavy a burden laid upon
me by my most obliging friend, Ι too shall lay a
burden upon you, counting upon the signal services
you have already done me——though indeed I should
be sorry to be a nuisance to you.

The people of Mylasa b and Alabanda ⁰ owe money
to Cluvius. Euthydemus told me, when I was at
Ephesus, that he would see that ecdici ‘¹ were sent by
the people of Mylasa to Rome. That was not done,
and now I hear that legates have been sent, but I
prefer ecdici, so that something definite may be done.

ecdici could plead at laW, but the cost of sending them was
almost prohibitive. See note a on Ep. 26. 3 above.
