EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. 1.

even if he is mistaken in being s0, it is a mistake due
to laek of sense more than lack of morality.

But to waste no more words (Ι must say it sooner 5
or later), I love Pomponius Atticus as a second
brother. He is to me the dearest and most delight-
ful man in the world. Now Atticus—not that he
is one of that lot, being a man of most refined erudi-
tion in every branch of liberal learning, but he lms
a great esteern for Patro, and had a great affection
for Phaedrus—Atticm, I say, the least sels-seeking
ofmen, and the least importunate in making requests,
entreats me to do this with as much earnestness as he
has ever evineed 3 and he has no doubt that Ι could
get you to grant him this favour by a single nod, even
ifit were still your intention to build. Now, however,
if he hears that you have abandoned that intention,
and that even so Ι have failed to get from you what
I want, he will not suspect you of shabbiness to me,
but me of lack of consideration for him. And that
is why I beg of you to write to your friends, sax ing
that with your full consent that decree of the
Areopagites, 11111611 they themselves 6311 3 me‘moire, α
may be rescinded.

But Ι return to what I said at first. Before per· 6
suading yourself to do this at all, I would have you
persuade yourself to do it readily, as a kindness to
myself. Anyhow, let me tell you this—if you do
what I ask, it will give me the greatest pleasure.
