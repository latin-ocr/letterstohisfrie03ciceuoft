that it will conduce to your own reputation also
(which I always have at heart), if when you reach that
island as its first quaestor, you set prcccdents for
others to follow; and this I hope you will the more
easily accomplish if you decide to follow the code of
your relative P. Lentulus‚“ and the regulations I in-
stituted myself.b Such a policy will, I am confident,
do you much credit.

CICERO To comus ⁶
(Date uncertain.)

There are many reasons os long standing for the
close attachment of Q. PompeiuS‚ son of SextuS‚ to
myself. As in the past it is in my recommendations
that he has got into the habit of finding support for
his fortunes, his reputation, and influence‚ he cer-
tainly ought just now, when you are governor of the
province, to profit by my letter so far as to be assured
that there is nobody to whom he has ever been more
highly commended. For that reason I beg of you
with exceptional earnestness, since in view of our
close association it is incumbent upon you to show
my friends as much respect as your own, to admit
this gentleman to your special friendsliip in such a
way as to convince him that nothing could possibly
have been of more service or more of a distinction
to him than my recommendation. Farewell.
