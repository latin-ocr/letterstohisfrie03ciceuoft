EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XVI. xx1v.—xxv.

On public affairs let me have every possible2
information that can be trusted—what Octavianus,
and what· Antony is up to, what is generally thought,
and what you suppose is going to happen. I can
hardly keep myself from coming to you hot-foot.
But Ι stand still;‘2 I patiently await a letter from
you 3 and let me tell you that Balbus was at Aquinum
on the day you were told, and Hirtius on the next
day. I imagine both were going there for the
waters3 but it is no business of mine! ὓ See that
Dolabella’s agents have their memories jogged.⁶
Send a reminder to Papia ἀ also. Good-bye.

MARCUS CICERO JUNIOR ‘³ TO TIRO
Athens, September or October, 44 13.c.

Although the excuse you offer for the break in your
correspondence is a fair and proper one, still 1 beg
you not to make too much of a practice of it. Al-
though rumours and messages keep me informed
about the political situation, and my father is
always writing to me, and fully too, about his
friendly feeling for you, for all that a letter written
by you to me about anything‚ however trivial, has
always been most welcome to me. For that reason,
seeing that I miss your letters more than anythfflg,
don't make the mistake of discharging the obligations
of correspondence by making excuses rather than by
assiduity in letter-writing. Good-bye.
