courage of that course it is now useless to discuss.

his absence, and that he will be a candidate on the
spot for the period covering three numlina.⁶ These
terms we have accepted, but only on condition that
he withdraws his garrisons from the places he has
occupied, so that the Senate may meet in Rome
to discuss these same terms with no sense of
apprehension.

If he does so, there is some hope of peace, though 4

upon us. But anything is better than that our
present plight should continue. If, however, he re·

but such a war as he could not possibly face (especially
after abandoning his own conditions), if only we cut

that we hope can be done, as we are holding levies on
an extensive scale ; and we believe that 116 15 afraid, if
once he begins to march upon the city, of losing the
two Gauls, both of which he finds extremely hostile to
him, with the exception of the Transpadani.‘² From
