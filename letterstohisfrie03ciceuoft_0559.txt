EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, II. xm.

Appius takes the view that hc is not prevented 3
by the Pupian lawa from holding a Senate on the
comitial days which follow the Quirinalia, and that
by the provisions of the Gabinian law he is even
compelled to grant a Senate to the emissaries every
day from February 1 to March 1. So it is thought that
the elections are being postponed till the month of
March. For all that the tribunes of the plebs declare
that they will settle the affair of Gabinius ὓ in the
course of these comitial days. I am collecting every
serap of news so that Ι may have something fresh
to tell you. But, as you see, it is just material that
fails me.

So I return to Callisthenes ⁶ and Philistus,‘² in both 4
of whom I see you have been wallowing. Callisthenes
is a hackneyed and commonplace piece of goods, as
several Greeks have remarked. The Sicilian is a
first—class writer, pithy, pointed, and concise, almost
a pocket-edition of 'fh11eydide33 but which of his
books you have had in your hands (for there are two
compilations), or whether you have had both, I don’t
know. The one on Dionysius gives me most pleasure ;
for Dionysius is a big rogue, and Philistus knows him
thoroughly. But about your postscript—do you
really intend taking up history? If I may say so,
you have the ability. And now that you are supply-
ing me with letter-carriers, you will hear to-day's
achievements on the Lupercalia. Amuse yourself
with our dear Cicero as agreeably as you can.
