CICERO

1)) 1115 e·1gernes 5 to suppott at all 60515 the publica zi,
11 ho 11 cre²³mai11ly dr aun from the Order to which 116
himself belong³ red, and which he consistently cham-
pioncd—the Ordcr of Knights (equester ordo), and
also by his anxiety to meet the views of his influential
friends at home ; with the result that, on the civil
side, his administration was no more, than moderately
successful, and 116 left the province little better than
he found it.

In his military capacity, on the other hand, he
showed surprising ability and resolution. Shortly
after his arrival his province was threatened by an
invasion of the Parthians 3 but so well did his forces
aequit themselves, especially on Mt. Amanus and
at Pindenissus—operations described by himself in
simple and lucid language—that, had he not been
forestalled by Cassius, who brilliantly repulsed the
Parthians at Antioch (an achievement he somewhat
ill—naturedly minimizes), he might have claimed the
credit of having avenged the death of Crassus at
Carrhae in 53.

Moreover, all through this critical period, with
little or no support from Rome, though hc repcatedly
appealed for it, Cicero checked all revolt in his pro-
vince, and kept the feudatory and allied potentates
quiet and well-disposed.

In view of these laudable achicvements there is
little doubt that his application for a triumph would
have been granted, had it not been opposed by no
less a man than M. Porcius Cato, who gives his reasons
for doing so in an elaborate and highly complimentary
letter (ΕΡ. 5), which is, however, not without a touch
of sarcasm, and Ciccro’s rcply is a model of courtesy
and sels—restraint under considerable provocation-
