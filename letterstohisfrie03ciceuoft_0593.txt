EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, 111. 1.

against him by rote as an exercise. My books,‘² all
of which you are eagerly awaiting‚ Ι have begun,
but cannot finish for the next few days. The speeches
in defence of Scaurus and Plancius, which you so in-
sistently demand, I have accomplished. The poem
to Caesar, which I had put together for final arrange-
ment, I have broken off. For you, since your own
wells of poesy are now running dry,b if Ι have any
spare time, I shall write what you request.

Ι come to your third letter. You say that Balbus 12
will come to Rome at an early date, handsomely
attended,c and that he will be with me without a
break till May 15 ; that will be very gratifying to
me, and will give me much pleasure. In the same
letter you urge me, as you often have before, to be
ambitious and strenuous3 well, Ι certainly shall be
so ; but when shall we begin to enjoy life ?

Your fourth letter I received on September 13 ; 13
you had posted it in Britain on August 10. There was
nothing new in it except about your Erigona ; if I get
it from Oppius, I’ll write and tell you what Ι think of
it ; but I have no doubt that Ι shall find it charming.
And there is that bit, too (I forgot to mention it),
about the man who, according to your letter, wrote
to Caesar about the applause given to Milo; well,
I have not the least obj ection to Caesar’s getting the
impression that nothing could have been heartier; and
such was undoubtedly the case. And yet the applause
given to Milo seems in a sense to be given to me.

I have also received a very old letter, but late in 14
its dehvery, in which you remind me of the temple
of Tellus and the colonnade of Catulus.‘³l Both works
are being carefully executed. Indeed, I have even
had a statue of you set up near the temple of Tellus.
