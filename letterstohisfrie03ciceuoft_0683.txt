v111 (Ι. 3 g 4)

CICERO To BRUTUS
Rome, April 27, 43 B.c.

We have lost two consuls, loyal men both, but 4
nothing more than loyal. Hirtius to be sure met his
death in the hour of victory, after he had won another
victory in a great battle a few days earlier.‘² They
were his victories, for Pansa had taken to ssight with
wounds which he could not endure. The remnants
of the enemy are being pursued by Brutus and
Caesar.b Now all those who have attached themselves
to Marcus Antonius’ following have been declared
public enemies, and according to the general construc-
tion put upon it this resolution of the Senate applies
also to your captives or capitulants. For my part I
used no specially harsh language when I pronounced
on Gaius Antonius in person, because Ι had decided
that the Senate must obtain the facts of the case from
you. April 27.
