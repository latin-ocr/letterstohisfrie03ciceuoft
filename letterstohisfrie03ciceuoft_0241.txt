CICERO To TERENTIA
Brundisium, July oth, 47 1³..c

I urote to tell Pomponius what my wishes were
later than Ι should have donc. When you haxe a
talk with him, you will understand what I should like
to be done. Since I have already written to him,
there is no necessity to write here more openly Ι
should like you to send me a letter as soon as possible

about that and everything else. Take particular care
ofyour health. Good- -by c. July 9th.

CICERO To TERENTIA
Brundisium, June 14th‚ 47 B.c.

If you are well, all is right3 I am well. Our
daughter Tullia joined me on June Ich. Her con-
summate excellence and exceptional kindliness have
aggravated my regret that my own carelessness is to
blame for her being in very different circumstances
from what her filial affection and her position de-
manded. It 1s my intention to send Cicero to Caesar,
and Cn. Sallustiusa with him. If he sets out I shall
inform you. Take particular care of your health.
Good-bye. June 14th.
