EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 1.

Gratidius α Ι need say nothing3 Ι 3111 well assured
that he is so anxious about his own reputation that, if
only out of cousinly affection for us, he is anxious
about ours. Your quaestorb is not a man of your 11
own deliberate 3616611011, but one assigned yon by
