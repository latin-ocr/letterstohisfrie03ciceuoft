EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, 11.

BRUTUS TO CICERO
Dyrrhachium, April 1, 43 B.c.

1 anxiously await the letter which you wrote on 1
receipt of the news of our campaign and of the death
of T rebonius.a I feel sure it contains forme an orderly
statement of your policy. A foul crime has taken
from us an excellent citizen and has wrested from us
the control of a province. To retrieve it is no
trouble 3 but it will be none the less a humiliation
and a scandal that we should be retrieving the loss
instead of preventing it.

Antonius b is still with me. But I'll take my oath 2
upon it, I am being impressed by the man's entreaties‚
and I am afraid that the passionate pleadings of
several persons may snatch him away. I am in a
downright sever. If Ι but knew what you would
have me do, I should be free from worry, for I should
be convinced that you know best. Therefore let me
know as soon as possible what you think right.

Our friend Cassius holds Syria and the Syrian 3

legions ι Murcus and Marcius ⁶ and the troops them-
selves actually called him in before he made a move.
I have written to my sister Tertia and my mother not
to publish the report of this splendid and most fortu-
nate exploit of Cassius before ascertaining what you
would advise, and what you think of it.

I have read your two speeches, the one which you 4
delivered on J anuary 1, and the other on my dis-
patches, when you spoke in opposition to Calenus.d

spokesman in the Senate. The two Philippics to which
Cicero refers here are the fifth and the seventh.
