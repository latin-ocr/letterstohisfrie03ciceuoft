Rome, inonth uncertain, 46 ιη’.

As regards the estate, investments, and Asiaticl
possessions of my intimate friend Caerellia‚‘¹ I com-
mended them to you as particularly as Ι could when
I was with you in your pleasure-garden ; and you, in
accordance with your custom, and your unfailing and
substantial services to me, most handsomely guaran-
teed that you would do everything you could. I hope
you remember that 3 I know you don't often forget.
But, be that as it may, Caerellia's agents have written
to me that, on account of the size of your province,
and your numerous business engagements‚ you have
to be relninded of that promise again and again.

I therefore beg ofyou to remember that you guaran- 2
teed to me that you would do everything compatible
wit-h your honour without any reserve whatever.
Now Ι believe you have an excellent opportunity
(though it is a matter for your own deliberation and
judgment) of obliging Caerellia, arising out of that
decree of the Senate which was passed in reference
to the heirs of C. Vennonius.b In the interpretation
of that decree you will use your own wisdom. Ι know
that the authority of that order has always been of
importance in your eyes. As to what remains to be
done, I would have you believe that in whatever
respects you prove your kindness to Caerellia you will
do me the greatest possible favour.
