INTRODUCTION

the consulship of 44 B.c.‚ who claimed Syria as his
province and had gained possession of the province
of Asia (W. Asia Minor) by a treacherous attack on
its governor, C. Trebonius. Though Cassius eventu-
ally overcame Dolabella, he was not in a position to
bring timely succour to the senatorial forces in Italy.

Meanwhile Brutus had gained possession of Mace-
donia and Illyria and had captured Antony's brother
C. Antonius, who had sought to occupy this province
for himself. During the spring and summer of 43 B.C.,
therefore, he was free to send an expeditionary force
to Italy. In March or early April, while Decimus
Brutus lay in great straits at Mutina, Cicero called
for M. Brutus’ intervention. After the battle of
Mutina he offered M. Brutus a free hand and sug-
gested his opening a campaign against Dolabella in
Asia Minor. In June and ,July, when Antony was
making his recovery, Cicero repeatedly summoned
Brutus to Italy, but Brutus refused to budge.
T hough he, like Cicero, had quarrelled with Antony‚
he was less determined to resist Antony ὰ l'outrance ;
he was allied with Lepidus by a marriage connexion ;
above all, he differed profoundly from Cicero in his
estimate of Octavian. While Cicero had his sus-
picions about Octavian, he hoped against hope to
retain him in the service of the Senate ; Brutus could
see nothing in Octavian but another usurper of
monarchy, like his adoptive father. On long views
Brutus was probably right ; yet it may be debated
whether in 43 B.C. he did not make a “ great refusal ''
and throw away the last chance of a Republican vic-
tory, or at least of a peace by compromise.
