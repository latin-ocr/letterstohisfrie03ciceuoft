I. Tm: TExT oF THE LETTERS ‘ro Bnnrus

THE 26 letters of which the text and translation are
given below constituted in ancient times the IXth
book of the published correspondence between Cicero
and Marcus Brutus, falling within the last few months
of Cicero's life (March or April to July‚ 43 13.c.).
1⁴'our other letters of earlier date survive in the collec-
tion of Cicero’s “ Letters to his Friends '' (xiii. 10-14);
they will be found in the translation of that series by
ΜΓ. Glynn Williams.

Of the 26 letters that compose the present volume
21 (nos. VI-XXVI, forming Bk. I according to the
traditional classiflcation) are preserved in a number of
mss„ mostly of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
of which the Codex Mediceus (M) is generally re-
garded as the most authoritative‚ · one main branch
of this family also contains the letters to Atticus and
to Quintus (icero. The remaining five letters (nos.
I- V, constituting Bk. II) remained unknown until
1593, when ·ι sdiolar named Cratinder transcribed
them from a simil) of mss which has since disappeared.

In all the uss. the letters are arranged out of their
proper chronological order; and certain small por-
tions of the text are plainly not in their correct place
—an error due to the transposition of several sheets
