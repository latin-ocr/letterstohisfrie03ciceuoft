defence. No, Marcus a must be called in 3 and when
he has spent much time and many a night elaborat-
ing his speech by lamplight, don't be so sure that
even he can prove your innocence.

Ι make a plain request of you ; just as in the old
days I remember my mother used to do—-she used to
seal up her wine-jars even when she had emptied
them, so as to prevent its being said that any were
empty which had been drained of their contents by a
thief3 on the same principle, I ask you, even if you
have nothing to write, to write all the same, and so
avoid the suspicion of having tried to get a day off
by stealing it.b Ι assure you, I aiways find the news
in your letters as trustworthy as it is charmingly

told. Keep on loving me, and good-bye.
