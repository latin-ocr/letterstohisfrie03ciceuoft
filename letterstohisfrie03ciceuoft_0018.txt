CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY

§zia On December 29 the tribune Q. Metellus
Nepos vetoed Cicero's address to the people on going
out of office, alleging that “ he had put citizens to
death without a trial'’; but Cicero's declaration
that he had thereby saved his country was received
with applause. This Metellus was one of Pompey's
officers and was probably instigated by his general,

who was chagrined that Cicero, and not he, should ⁴

have quelled the conspiracy.
