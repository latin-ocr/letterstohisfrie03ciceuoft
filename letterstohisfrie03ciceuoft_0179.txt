EPIST. AD FAMILIARES, XIII. mur-wa.

to you in a few words, and yet in such a way as to give
you a clear appreciation of my friendly feeling for
him. You cannot believe how highly both my brother,
who is very dear to me, and myself esteem M.
Laenius. It is the result not only of his numerous
services to me, but also of his unimpeachable in-

parted with him with the greatest reluctance, not
only on account of our intimacy and the charm of
our intercourse, but also because it was a pleasure to
me to avail myself of his counsel, as honest as it was
sound.

But I fear you will think I have a superfluity of 2
words after saying that Ι should run short of them.
well, I commend the man to you as heartily as I am
bound to commend one of whom Ι have written such
words as the above3 and I earnestly beg of you
again and again to expedite such business as he has
in your province, and to give him personally such
information as you think proper. You will find him
a most affable and gentlemanly fellow. And so I ask
you to send him back to me as soon as you can, un-
embarrassed, free, and with all his business settled as
far as you are concerned in it. Your doing so will

greatly' gratify my brother and myself.
