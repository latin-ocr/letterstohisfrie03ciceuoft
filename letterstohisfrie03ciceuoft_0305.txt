EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. vin—xm.

my glory, Ι am, and I am bound to be, heart and soul
at the disposal of all of you, especially as I am fully
conscious of the energctic support (more than should
have been demanded of any woman) given to my
welfare and position by that most sterling and excel-
lent lady, your mother. And that is my justification
for entreating you with special earnestness to show
your esteem for me by defending me in my absence.

VIII

CICERO TO GAIUS MARCELLUS,⁰ HIS BROTHER AUGUR
Between Iconium and Cybistra, early in September, 51 13.c.

That your son Marcellus has been made consul, and
that you have felt that thriil ofjoy for which you most
devoutly prayed, is an incxpressible pleasure to me,
and that not only on his own account, but because I
consider that you also richly deserve all that the
happiest fortune can bestow. 1³01· Ι have had convinc-
ing proof of your incomparable goodness of heart
towards me whether in my troubles or in my triumphs;
in short I have found your whole family most enthusi-
astic and eager in their support of my civil standing or
official distinction (call it which you will). For that
reason you will do me a kindness if you pass on my
congratulations to that most sterling and excellent
lady, your wife Junia. I beg of you to do what you
always have done—to show your regard for me and
defend me in my absence.
