EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XVI. xlx.—xx.

Send me back my Demetrius‚‘² and send me anything
else you can, isit is good. In the matter of Aufidius‘s ὸ
debt, I put no pressure upon you. Ι know it is an
anxiety to you. But settle the business. If that
is what detains you, I accept the excuse3 if that
is not holding you back, come here post-hasfe. I
am eagerly awaiting a letter from you. Good-bye.

CICERO To TIRO

Rome, end of 45 Β. c.

Upon my life, my dear Tiro, your health worries
me; but I feel sure that if y ou devote ’that attention
to it which 3ou have begun to do, 3ou will soon be
well again. Please arrange m3 books and make a
catalogue of them when Metlodorus ⁰ has no objec-
tion: since 3ou have got ‘co live according 'co his in-
junctions. Settle 33 nh the gardener ἀ as 3ou think
proper. You can see the gladiators on January lst‚
and return the next day, t>and that is what I think
3ou ought to do. But just as 3ou please. Take
particular care of yourself‚ as you love me. Good-
bye.

⁶ Tiro's physician.
