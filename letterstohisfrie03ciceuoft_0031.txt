§L Caesar, now consul for the fifth time and
dictator for the fourth, had already by his arrogance
and ill-concealed ambition aroused the opposition of
the republicans, and a conspiracy had long been
maturing which culminated in his assassination on
March 15 at the foot of Pompey's statue in the
senate-house. By his will he adopted C. Octavius
and made him his chief heir.

§Q On the l7th, at a meeting of the Senate in
the temple of Tellus, Cicero proposed an amnesty,
which the Senate passed, but at the same time ratified

all Caesar’s acts. After this he retired into private
life for six months.
