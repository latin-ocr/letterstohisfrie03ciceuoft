EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xn.-xi11.

keep him safe. Ι consider that this is as clear a case
as any of a call to duty in a private affair.

While I was writing this note, I was handed a 3
dispatch from Satrius, the legate of Trebonius, that
Dolabella had been cut up and routed by Tillius ‘¹
and Deiotarus.¹' Ι have sent you a letter in Greek
from a certain Cicereius to Satrius.

Our friend Flavius ⁰ has chosen you umpire in a 4
dispute about a legacy which he has on hand with
the people of Dyrrhachium. I beg you, Cicero, and
Flavius begs you, to settle the matter. It is not in
doubt that the person who appointed Flavius as his
heir had the money owing to him by the city, and
the people of Dyrrhachium do not deny it ; but they
allege that the debt was remitted in their favour
by Caesar. Do not suffer a wrong to be done to my
close friend by yours. May 19, in camp, at the base
of the Candavia valley.

CICERO TO BRUTUS
Rome, about May ΞΟ, 43 B.C.

L. Clodius, a tribune of the plebs elect, has a great 1
fondness or, to express myself with more verve, a
great love for me. Having satisfied myself of this,

Ι have no doubt you will conclude (for vou can read
me like a book) that I requite his lov.e For it seems
to me that nothing less becomes a man than to make
no response to those who would draw you out in
mutual love. Ι have had the impression that he
suspects (and does so indeed to his own great distress)
