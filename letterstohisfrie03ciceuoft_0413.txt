EPISTL'LAE AD FAMILIARES, XVI. xxvn.

had told me in his letter with some reserve, evi-
dently being modest about it, and also in a hurry,
all that you have written to me, stating the facts
without sycophan0y3 and particularly as regards
the consuls-designate,a who Ι am absolutely assured
are tainted with sensualism and a weak-mindedness
that is essentially womanish; and unless they
resign the helm, there is every danger of universal
shipwreck.

You could never believe what I know those men
did in summer quarters, when the camp of the
Gauls was right opposite them—men whom that
scoundrel,b unless< firmer measures are taken, will
captivate by making them share in his vices. Things
must be buttressed up by either the tribunes or
private persons taking eounsel together. For as to
those two fellows, they are hardly fit to be en-
trusted‚ the one with Caesena,c and the other with
the vaults under Cossutius’s wine-shops.‘² As I
said, Ι have you ever before my facee I shall see you
all on the 30th‚ and as for that face of yours, even
ifI see you in the middle of the sorum on my arrival,
I shall smother it with kisses. Keep on loving
me. Good-bye.

tion would be open to objection.
