NOTE ON CICERO’S GOVERNORSHIP OF
CILICIA

ClcERo left Rome for Cilicia in 51 13.c. as reluctantly
as Macaulay left London for India in 1834. Both
were profoundly devoted to their respective mother-
cities, and loved city life 3 both dreaded the friend-
less solitude of what they regarded as banishment
in a distant land; and both apprehended a fatal
break in the continuity of their political careers at
home.

Cicero arrived in Laodicea at the end of July,
having with him as his legati ‘² his brother Quintus,
C. Pomptinus, M. Anneius, and L. Tullius. His
province, besides Cilicia proper, included Pisidia,
Pamphylia, Cyprus, Isauria, Lycaonia, and three
departments (διοικήσεις) north of Taurus, the chief
towns of which were Cibyra, Synnada, and Apamea.

As a civil administrator he appears to have had
every desire to improve the conditions of the pro-
vincials and undo the harm wrought by his pre-
decessor, the “ tigerish '' Appius Claudius Pulcher3
but his good intentioris were too often neutralized

⁰ A governor's leyen, selected by himself, but with the

approval of the Senate, performed any service he thought fit
to assign them, whether civil or military.
