CICERO

on behalf of the Cyprians. These letters afford con-
vincing proof of Cicero's extraordinary public influ-
ence and authority, the variety of his interests, and
the wide scope os his sympathies. ’

The remaining seventy-two letters are commen-
datory of individuals. That they should generally
conform 'co a common type is not surprising. Those
who are constantly called upon for “ testimonials ”
know how difficulty it is to avoid the repetition of
certain stock phrases. Cicero indeed strives‚ with
his usual flueney and felicity, 'to vary his theme, but
even he faiis to break the monotony of these letterS‚
of which the following may be taken as a ‘⁴ skeleton ''
specimen ι

“ A is a man to whom I am so much attached that I
shall regar-d whatever you do for kim as done sor
wyse( f. I therefore entreat you with more than ordinary
eat-aestuem to do him this particular favour, and to
befriend him in every other respect, so far as your
integrity (honestgs, sense of justice) and your high
position permit os it.'’ [These words recall the
frequent phrase in Buekingham’s letters recommend-
ing friends to Baeon when Lord Chancellor-—“ So
far as may stand wille justice ancl equit-ys] Cicero
{zoes on : ‘⁸ Yon wilt find A an arcellemfellow, worthgs
of your 'sriemlshiffi and most grateful ⁴sor any service
⁸aaa may (lo lcim.'’ He often, however, discounts the
altruism ofa letter by adding, with Pepysian candour,
“ Pray malfe it quite clear to A that it was I who induced
you to do lzim this k2'7zdness,'’ and he sometimes
attaches to a reeommendation a preconeerted private
mark, indicating that it is to receive particular
attention.

Insipid and monotonous, however, as these letters
