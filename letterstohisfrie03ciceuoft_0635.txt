EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. v111.

are all of‘you in strict agreement with what I think
myself. I will go bail to Caesar for Messalla’s con-
duct. But Memmius pins his hopes on Caesar’s

that side. Milo is alarmed at this, and rightly so,
and if Pompey is made dictator, he almost gives up
hope. If he helps anyone who vetoes the dictator-
