EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, m.
XXI (1. 13)

BRUTUS TO CICERO
In camp, July 1, 43 B.c.

My fear of what is to follow makes me feel alarmed l
about M. Lepidus. If he has bolted from us-—and I
would fain hope that people’s suspicions about him
are unfounded and do him injustice-—I beg and
entreat you, Cicero, in 1116 name of our close friend-

am I to offer to my 11101 her or sister or those boys,
if 1n your eyes and those of the Senate their uncle
Brutus carries no weight against 111611· father Lepidus?

you at length, nor is that my duty. For if in such
an important and intimate matter Ι must expend
words in order to rouse your interest and make up
your mind, there is no hope of your doing what I
wish and what duty bids. Therefore don't expect
a long supplication. Look into my heart: it is I
who have a right to this favour from you, either on
private considerations‚ because you are Cicero, my
intimate friend,or,personal ties apart‚ because of your
