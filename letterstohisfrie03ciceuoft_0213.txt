CICERO'S LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS
BOOK XIV
I

CICERO To TERENTIA ΛΝΒ HIS FAMILY⁰

Begun at Thessalonica, flnished at Dyrrachium,
Nov. 25, 58 ηε.

Ι am kept informed by the letters of many and the 1
conversation of everybody that your courage and
fortitude, Terentia, are beyond belief, and that you
are not exhausted by your troubles either of mind
or body. WVoe is me! To think that you of all
people‚ virtuous‚ faithful, upright‚ and generous as
you are, should have fallen into such a morass of
misery all on my account! And that our dai-ling
Tullia should feel that the very father who was her
greatest delight is now the source of her greatest
griefs ἒ As to Cicero, why should I talk about him,
since from the very dawn of his intelligence he has
known the bitterest pangs of sorrow and misery?
Could I but imagine that all this is (as you write) the
work of destiny‚ I should bear it a little more easily 3
but it has all been brought about by my own fault,
because I thought myself beloved by those who were

and dishonesty were justified. His letters show a gradual
waning of his affection for her, and he divorced her in 46 1³.c.
