EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xxw.

For of all the civil wars in our state which I can recall,
none were waged on such terms but that whichever
side won, at all events some form of free state would
have survived. In the present war I should not find
it easy to lay down what manner of free state we shall
have, if we are to be the winners 3 if we lose, the free
state will certainly disappear for ever. Ι therefore
advocated severe measures against Antony and
against Lepidus, not so much for retribution’s sake,
as to diseourage and deter evil—minded citizens from
attacking their country at the present time, and to
set up a warning example for the future, so that none
should feel inclined to repeat such acts of madness.

And yet this particular measure did not reflect ll
mine any more than the universal opinion. You see
vindictiveness in this, that the penalty extends to
the innocent children. But that is an ancient usage
and common to all states, if it be true that even
Thermistocles’ children were left destitute3 and if
the same punishment falls upon citizens condemned
by a court, how could we be more lenient towards
public enemies ? And what complaint can any man
make about me, if he cannot help confessing that if
victory had been his he would have treated me more
harshly? You have the reasoned statement of my ’
views on this particular subject of honour and>
punishment 3 Ι believe you have heard my opinions
and pronouncements on other matters.

But of course this is not so urgent 3 what is highly 12
urgent, Brutus, is that you should come to Italy
with your army at the earliest possible moment. We
are awaiting you most anxiously. Why, if you land
in Italy there will be a general rush to meet you!
For suppose we win‚ and a very handsome victory
