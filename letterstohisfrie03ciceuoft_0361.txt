CICERO To TIRO

Actium, November 7 (evening)‚ 50 13.c.

I Tullius and Cicer0‚ and the two Quinti, send
warmest greetings to Tiro.

This is the third letter I have written to you on l
the same day, more for the sake of keeping to my
established practice (having found a man to whom I
may entrust it), than because I have anything to
write. So I only say this: show as much regard
for yourself as is your regard for me. Add this to
your countless kindnesses to me, and it will be the
most acceptable of them all 3 when you have given
full consideration to your health‚ as I hope you will,
then give consideration to your voyage also.

Please give letters to me to all who are on their 2
way to Italy 3 Ι never pass over anybody who is on
his way to Patrae. Take care, take care of yourself‚
my dear Tiro. Since you were not fortunate
enough to sail in my company, there is no reason
why you should hurry, no reason why you should
take thought for anything but your health. Again
and again, good-bye 1 Actium, November 7th‚ in the
evening.
