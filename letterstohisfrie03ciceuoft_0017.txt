designs of L. Sergius Catilina, of which he had full
information from the spy, L. Curius In the consular
elections for 62 Catiline was again defeated. On
October 21 Cicero foretold the rising of the Catili-
narian Manlius in Etruria on the 27 th. Martial law
was prochaimed, and the conspirators failed in an
attempt to seize Praeneste on November 1, and
another plot to murder Cicero was exposed. But
Catiline had the audac-it)v to appear in the Senate on
November 8, when Cicero so crushingly denounced
him that he left Rome to take command of the
insurgents in Etruria.

approached by the conspirators to supply Catiline
with caval1y,uere arr ested, and on the strength of
incriminating letters found upon them the following
five conspirators were seized and imprisoned—-P,
Ientulus Sura (praetor,) C. Cethegus (senator), L.
Statilius, P. Gabinius Cimbel, and M. Caeparius;

then praetor elect, was opposed to it, a decree was
carried that the five conspirators arrested should be
put to death, and that same evening they were
strangled under Cicero’s supervision.
