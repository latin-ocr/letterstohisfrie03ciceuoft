EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. mom—LXXVI.

but he imagines it to be of importance to him that I
should write to you as frequently as possible. So
please forgive me if in thus complying with his wishes
I lead you to suspect that my recollection of your
constancy is not as clear as it should be.

I also make this further request of you—to accom- 2
modate Avianius as regards both the place and the
time at which he is to discharge his corn.‘¹ It was
through me also that he secured both these privileges
for a term of three years, when Pompey was in chief
charge of that business. The main point is this (and
you might greatly oblige me in that respect), that you
should make it your object to convince Avianius, since
he already assumes my affection for him, of your affec-
tion for me. That will give me great pleasure.

So strong are the reasons for my association with 1
Q. Hippius that nothing could be closer than the ties
which bind us. &Vere it not so, I should observe my
usual practice and avoid giving you the slightest
trouble. Indeed, you yourselves can best testify to
the fact that, though I was convinced I could make
no request of you which you would not grant, it has
never been my wish to impose a burden upon you.

I therefore earnestly beg you again and again to 2
pay me the compliment of treating C. Valgius

Fabrateria, a restoration of Fregellae (on the Liris in
Latium), under a new name.
