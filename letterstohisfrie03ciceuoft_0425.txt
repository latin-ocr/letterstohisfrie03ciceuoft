heart and to face, or even hurry forward to meet, your
responsibilities. As a matter of fact, the department
of the State you are administering 13 1101 0116 111 which
fortune plays a ruling par,t but 0116 111 which 3
reasoned policy combined with assiduity carries the
greatest power3 1111613613 if I saw th 11 1116 prolonga-

tion of your gov erm-nent happened during your
management of some great and dangerous war, I
should shudder in spirit because it would be evident
to me that at the same time fortune's power over 113
had been prolonged.

As it is, however, you have been entrusted with a 5
department of the St· ate in which fortune holds 110
part, or a very insignificant one, and which, it would

revolt of allies, no lack of tribute or corn-supply, no
mutiny in the army, —evils which have befallen the
wisest of men, so that, just as the best of helmsmen
cannot defy the 110161166 of a tempest, neither 6311
they defy 1116 33331111 of fortune. W hat has been

For your province consists, in the first place, of that 6
type of 31111α which of all types of humanity is the
most civilized3 and secondly, of that type of citizen ⁰
who, either because 11161 316 publzcam are attached

security of the fortunes they enjoy is due to the
blessing of my consulship.
