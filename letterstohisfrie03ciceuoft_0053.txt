EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. 1v.-v.

effort, I should omit, whereby I might be of service
[0 them. But since I an] confident that I have no less
influence with you at thc present moment than Ι have
always had with everylwdy, I beg of you in the name
of our very close connexion and our mutual goodwill,
so evenly balanced between us, to serve the people of
Volaterrae in such a way as to give them the impres-
sion that, as if by some (livine providence, the man
who has been put at the head of the commission on
which you are now engaged is the very man of all
others with whom Ι, their unfailing defender, could
exercise the greatest possible influence.

CICERO To VALERIUS ORCA

Rome, autumn, ι15 ss.c.

M. T. Cicero warmly grects Q. Valerius Orca, son
of Quintus, legate with rank of Praetor.

I have no obj ection to any number of people being 1
aware of the close relationship between us ; and yet I
would not for that reason (and you can best appreciate
what I say) hinder you from being able to conduct the
business you have undertaken with your usual probity
and thoroughness, and to the satisfaction of Caesar,
who has entrusted you with a commission as im-
portant as it is difficult ; for though I am besieged by
petitions from a host of men because they confidently
rely upon your goodwill towards me, I am not so
inconsiderate as to embarrass you in the performance
of your duty by any self- secking on my own
account.
