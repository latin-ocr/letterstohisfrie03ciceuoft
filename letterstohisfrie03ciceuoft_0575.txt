EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, ΙΙ. Χνῐ.

There were very heated discussions for several 2
days in the Senate on the question of bribery and
corruption, the candidates for the consulship having
gone to such lengths as could no longer be tolerated ;‘¹
but Ι was notin the House. I have made up my mind
to make no move in the direction of remedying the
ills of the State without a powerful backing.

On the day I am writing this, Drusus ὸ has been 3
acquitted on a charge of praevaricatio ⁰ by the tribuni
aerarii ἆ by four votes in the final count, though the
senators and knights had condemned him. This
same afternoon I am going to defend Vatinius! That
will be an easy matter. The comitia have been post-
poned to the month of September. Scaurus's trial will
be brought on forthwith‚ and I shall not fail to sup-
port him. Your Soplzoclean Banquetersf 1 don't at all
like, though I see that you played your part with
e'clat.

I now come to a topic which I should perhaps have 4
taken first. Oh 1 what a delightful letter was yours
to me about Britain 1 Ι dreaded the ocean, Ι dreaded
the coast of that island. What remains of your
enterprise I do not underrate‚ but it is more hopeful
than alarming, and it is just the eager anticipation of
it rather than apprehension that makes me restleSS.
I can see, however, that you have glorious subject
matter for your pen. What encampments, what
natural characteristics of things and places, what
manners and customs, what tribeS, and what battles
you have to write about, and, finally, what a man in
your commander-in—chief himself Ξ Ι shall willingly
assist you, as you ask me, in any way you wish, and

perturbed at the incident, in which Quintus appears to have
been involved.
