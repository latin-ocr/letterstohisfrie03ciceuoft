of litei-ary effort‚ and his eagerness to do justice to

the immortal glory of your achievements is quite
amazing.

o inion 3 but such is your extraordinary penetration

your own account. And here am I, after all, doing
what I said I would not do, in recommending him
to you !

Whatever favour you do him will be a more than
ordinary gratification to myself.

CICERO To ssi-wius sumamus RUFUs⁰

house has been unreservedly thrown open to me ; had
there been need, I should have used it as my own.
