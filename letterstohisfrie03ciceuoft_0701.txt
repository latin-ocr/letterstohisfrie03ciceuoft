EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, nv.

CICERO ΤΟ BRUTUS

Rome, about May 520, 43 ac.

My note had already been written and sealed up l
when your letter came to hand with its big budget
of news, and most astonishing of all, that Dolabella
had sent five cohorts to the Chersonese.‘² Is he so
over-provided with troops, that when reported in
flight from Asia he should make a dash at Europe ?
But five cohorts ἔ Whatever djd he expect to achieve
with those, when you had five legions in the sanie
quarter, an excellent cavalry and very strong auxili-
ary forces ? Indeed, seeing that the bandit has
committed such a mad act, l hope that by now those
cohorts are in your possession.

I heartily commend your strategy, in that you did 2
not move your army from Apollonia and Dyrrha-
chium until you had heard of the flight of Antony,
of Brutus' sortie, of the Roman people’s victory.
Therefore when you decided (as you inform me) to
conduct your army to the Chersonese and not to
suffer that utter scoundrel of an enemy to insult the
sovereignty of Rome, your action is in keeping with
your high position and in the interests of the state.

As for the mutiny which was caused, so you say, by 3
the intrigues of C. Antonius among the fourteenth
legion, you will take it in good part—I think better
of the strong measures taken by the troops than of
your leniency. . . .
