EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 1.

province, while they dwell upon your virtues, your
integrity, and your kindliness, do make one reserva-
tion, and that is your irascibility. Now not only does
that failing seem to betray a capricious and feeble
mind, in this private and everyday life of ours, but
there is nothing so repulsive as this intrusion into
supreme command of acerbity of temper. Ι shall
not therefore take upon myself to lay before you
now the repeated utterances of the greatest philo-
sophers on the subject of irascibility, as I should
not like to be tedious, and you can easily discover
them in many writers3 but the special purpose of
a letter—the enlightenment of the recipient on
matters of w hich he has no knowledge—that purpose,
I think, should not be overlooked.

Well, what practically everybody reports of you is 38
this—that, as long as you keep your temper, they find
you the pleasantest person in the world ; but when
you are upset by some fellow’s rascality or wrong·
headedness, you become so exasperated that every·
body siglis for your vanished kindliness. Therefore‚
since we have been brought, not so much by any kind
of desire for glory as by the mere force of circum-
stances and by fortune, into such a position oflife that
men are likely to talk about us for all time, let us be
careful, to the best of our ability and power, to avoid
its being said of us that we had any particularly
notorious failing. And I am not now urging you to
do what is perhaps difficult in human nature at any
time, but especially at our time of life, and that 1s to
change one's disposition and suddenly to pluck out
some evil deeply ingrained in the character ; but this
much advice I do give you, that ifyou cannot possibly
avoid it, because anger takes possession of the mind
