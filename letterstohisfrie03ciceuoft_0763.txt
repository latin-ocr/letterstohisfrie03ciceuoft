EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xxm—XXVI.

require of it a high performance as of right, and
when things fall out otherwise we assail men with
reproaches for the deception they have practised on
113. Therefore Cicero‘s defiance of Antony calls for
the highest pmise, yet because it is assumed that
tlw historic consul is morally bound to set the stan·
dard for to-day's consular, no one is impressed.

But if the same Cicero should defer to others in 11
1113 convictions, which he applied so resolutely and in
such a grand manner when he bundled Antony out,
he will find that he not only has thrown away his
reputation for the future, but will also ensure that his
past achievements shall be blotted out—for nothing
is great in itself that does not bear the plain mark
of reasoned judgement—; because no one man is
better fitted to be a patriot and to champion liberty
with wise thoughts or brave deeds, or with the devo-
tion and the imperious call to leadership of the entire
community. For these reasons we must not beg
Octavius to deign to keep us safe. No, no! You
must rouse yourself up, and realize that the state
which was the scene of your greatest achievements
will enjoy its freedom and honour on these terms
alone, if leaders are forthcoming for the people in
making a stand against the policies of reprobates.
