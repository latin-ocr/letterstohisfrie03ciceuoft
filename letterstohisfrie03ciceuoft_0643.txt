About Felix’s ὓ will, you would complain still more 8

slip was due to a mistake on his own part as much as
on that of his slave Sicura), he did not 5631,· the
document he djdn’t want to 5631,116 scaled! But
let him go hang, so long as we keep our health.

I love your Cicero as you ask me to, and as he 9
deser ves, and as I am bound to do. But Ι am letting
him leave me for two reasons 3—so as not to take him
away from his teacherS, and because his mother
never leaves Porcia's side, and when she is away
the boy' 5 voracity appals me. But for all that we
have a great deal of each other' s company. I have
now answeied all youl inquilies, my dearest and
best of brothers. Good- -.bye
