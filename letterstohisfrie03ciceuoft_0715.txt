CICERO To BRUTUS

Rome, middle of June, 43 B.c.

I have so far received no letter from you, no, nor 1
even a rumour to notify me that you were acquainted
with the Senate's resolution and were bringing an
army to Italy. The free state is most anxious that
you should do so, and that quickly‚ for our home
troubles are growing more serious every day, and our
difficulties with our enemies in the field are no greater
than with those inside the gate. These enemies were
present since the very beginning of the war, but it
used to be easier to suppress them. The Senate had
been encouraged‚ not only by our formal statements
of opinion, but also by our calls fo action, to take up
a stiffer attitude. In the Senate Pansa displayed
sufficient energy and zeal in dealing m‘th the others
of this sort and especially with his father-in-law⁰;
in his consulship he showed no lack of spirit from the
outset, and no lack of loyalty at ’the end.

The operations at Mutina were being conducted 2
in such a manner that no fault could be found with
Caesar, albeit a certain amount with Hirtius. The
luck of this war was

Fran for prosperous times, but good for times of woe.

Victory was the free state’s when Antony's forces
