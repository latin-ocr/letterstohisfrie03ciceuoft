EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, 1X.

absent persons into consideration at the elections of
priests. In fact, this has been done before now, for
when Gaius Marius was in Cappadocia, he was made
augur under the Domitian law, and no statute has
ruled out this procedure for the future. There is
also a phrase in the Julian law,⁰ the latest measure
to regulate the priesthoods ε “ whosoever shall make
application or be taken into consideration.'' This
plainly implies that a person not applying may also be
taken into consideration. I have written to him, so
that he may avail himself of your advice on this as
on all other matters 3 but it is for you to settle the
case of Domitius ὓ and our friend Cato.⁰ And yet,
although it may be lawful to take an absent person
into consideration, everything is made easier all the
same for those who are present ; and if you decide
that you must go to Asia, there will be no opportunity
of summoning our candidates to the polls.

If Pansa were still alive, I believe that everything 4
all round would have moved faster, for he would have
held the by-election for his new colleague without
loss of time, and then the elections for the priest—
hoods would have preceded those for the praetorships.
Now I can see that the auspices will cause a long
delay ; for so long as an individua] patrician remains
in the magistracy, the auspices cannot revert to the
patriciate.‘² Quite an imbroglio, I do declare Ξ Ι wish
you would let me know your opinion on the whole
question. May 5.
