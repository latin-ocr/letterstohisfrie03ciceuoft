EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. xxix.

I am quite the most closely attached to you, not only
on such grounds as give the appearance of close
attachment, but on those also which are established
by familiarity and intercourse ; and my intercourse
with your father was, as you are aware, in the fullest
sense as agreeable as it was close. That was the
origin of my affection for you, which has enhanced
this hereditary association, and all the more so
because I realized that as soon as your years enabled
you to form an estimate as to the regard in which you
should hold each of your acquaintances, it was I who
began to be the special object of your respect,
esteem, and affection. Then there was added the
bond (no slight one), not only of common pursuits—,-
a bond which carries weight of itself—but also of
such pursuits and accomplishments as firmly unite
men of identical tastes in what becomes intimacy as
well.

You are curious to know, I am sure, what is the 2
drift of a preamblethat stretches so far back. Well
then, let me immediately assure you that Ι have not
entered into this recapitulation of facts without good
and sufficient reason. I am on very intimate terms
with C. Ateius Capito.a The vicissitudes of my
fortunes are familiar to you. In every phase of
my career, whether distinguished or distressful‚ C.
Capito has ever been at hand to help me with his
courage, energy‚ influence, popularity, and even his
purse, and to obey the call of every crisis in my
fortunes.

He had a relative, one T. Antistius3 and when 3
this man was holding Macedonia as quaestor accord-
ing· to lot, and had not yet been succeeded, Pompey
arrived in that province with an army. Antistius
