NOTE ON “LITTERAE COMMENDATICIAE ”

must appear to those who read ’rheni en masse, they
are yet impressive evidence of Cicero’s large-hearted
bonhomie, and his unfailing readiness to do a friend,
or even an acquaintance, a good turn; in short, of
that humanitas which was one of his dominam:
characteristics.
