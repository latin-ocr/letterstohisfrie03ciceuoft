citizens, but almost in the whole of Achaia.

Such is the man for whom I am merely opening the 2
door and paving the way to your acquaintance ; when
you know him, you will, with your innate sense of
justice, pronounce him worthy of your friendship and
hospitality on your own account.

I therefore beg of you, when you have perused this
letter, to take him under your protection, and promise
to do all you can for him for my sake. For the rest, if,
as I am confident you will, you find that he is likely to
be worthy of your friendship and hospitality, I beg of
you to give him a hearty welcome, make much of him ‚
and count him among your friends. That will give
me more than ordinary plcasure.

C. Avianius Flaccus,“ and besides I have heard from
his own lips, excellent and grateful man that he is,
how generously he has been treated by you. It is his
sons I now commend to you as being most worthy of
such a father, and close friends of my own, of whom
I am particularly fond, and there are no men I
could commend to you with greater enthusiasm. C.
