EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, III. vm.

if you constantly throw your thoughts back to the
purpose of our original policy, and what we then had
in view, you will find less difficulty in enduring your
military labourS‚ and any thing else that is obnoxious
to you; and, afte1 all, you can give up those duties
u henev er you plcase· , but the hour for that has not
arrived, though it is already approaching.

Ι give you this piece of advice also—not to commit 2
to any form of writing anything the publication of
vhich may cause us annoyance. There are many
things 1 would rather not know than be told of
them at some considerable risk. I shall write to
you at greater length with a mind free from care
when my Cicero, as I hope he will be, is in comfortable
health. Please be careful to let me know to whom
I ought to entrust the letter I shall send you later on
—to Caesar's letter-carrierS, so that he may send
them straight to you, or to Labienus’s ; for I have
no idea where those Nerviia of yours are, and how
far off they are.

Your letter about the courage and dignity of 3
Caesar, which, as you tell me, he displayed in the
midst of his intense sorrow‚⁶ was a source of great
pleasure to me. You bid me finish the poem ad·
dressed to him which I have begun 3 well, in spite of
the distractions ofwork, and far more of my thoughts,
still, now that Caesar has got to know from a letter
which I sent you that I have something on the stocks,
I shall return to what I have begun, and shall finish
it during these leisure days of the supplzcatiorze53 and
I am greatly delighted that during those days our
friend Messalla and the rest have at last been reliev ed
sioni annoy ance3 and in reckoning upon him as
certain to be consul together with DomitiuS, you
