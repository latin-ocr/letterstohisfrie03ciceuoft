Arae Alexandri, near Issus, between the 14th and 15th
of October, 51 B.c.

By your recommendation you present M. Fadius ὁ l
to me as a friend 3 well, I gain nothing by that. As a
matter of fact he has been for many years entirely at
my disposal, and I have liked him for his extreme kind-
ness and the respect he shows me. But for all that the
discovery that you are extraordinarily fond of him
has made me much more of a friend to him. And so,
although your letter has had its effect, yet what re-
commends him a great deal more is that Ι have
come fully to see and understand his kindly feelings
for yourself.

But in the matter of Fadius I will do what you ask
with hearty goodwill ; as for yourself, I only wish for
many reasons that you had been able to meet me, in
the first place so that I might see you after so long an
interval—you whom I have for long past valued so
highly ; secondly, that I might congratulate you ⁶ in
person as I have done by letter3 furthermore, that
we might share our views about whatever matters we
wished, you about your affairs, I about mine 3 and
lastly, that our friendship which has been fostered on
either side by the most notable good services, but has
had its continujty broken by long periods of interrup-
tion, might be more effectually strengthened.
