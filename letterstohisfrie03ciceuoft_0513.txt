EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRA'I‘REM, II. 1.

After that Racilius called upon me first of the 3
unofficial senators for my opinion. Ι spoke at great
length on all the insane and murderous acts of
P. Clodius ; I arraigned him as though he were in
the dock, amid the frequent appr-ming murmurs of
the whole Senate. My speech w as praised at quite
sufficient length and, Ι assure y‚ou with no little
eloquence, by V etus Antistius, a who also took upon
himself the defence of the priority of the trials—a
priority he said he would regal-d as being of capital
importance. The senators were crossing the floor in
favour of this opinion, when Clodius, being called
upon, set about talking out the sitting. He declared
in a frenzy of rage that Racilius had worried him in
an insulting ‘ind unmannerly way. Thereupon his
hired ruffians on the Graecostasisb and the steps of
the senate· house raised quite a fierce 3 ell, incited, Ι
suppose, to attack Q. Sextilius and Milo's friends.
Under the cloud of that sudden al arm, we bre-ke up,
with strong protests on every side. So much for the
transactions of a single day. What remains to be done
will, I imagine, be put off to the month of January.
Among the tribunes of the plebs by far the best man
we have is Racilius. It seems likely that Antistius too
will be friendly to us. As for Plancius, ⁶ he is with
us heart and soul. As 3ou love me, see to it th at
you are deliberate and careful about taking ship now
‘that Decembe1 is with us.
