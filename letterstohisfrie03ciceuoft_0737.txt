EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xxm.

excellently posted up about everything and can
explain and convey it to you in the most accom-
plished style. You must not suppose, Brutus—
though Ι need not tell you what you know already 3
yet for all that I cannot pass over in silence his high
pre-eminence in all noble pursuits—you must not
imagine that in the matter of good character, firmness
of purpose, conscientiousness‚ and zeal for the free
state there is anything to approach him ; so much so
that methinks the art of oratory‚ in which he holds 3,
wonderful supremacy, scarcely finds scope for eulogy
in such a man l And yet his merit stands out all the
more in this very expertness of knowledge t 50 severe
was the judgement, so exacting the technique, with
which he has trained himself in the soundest style of
oratory. And his application is so great, he spends
5ο many hours of the night in study‚ that most of the
credit does not go to his natural endowment, which
in his case is consummate !

But my affection is carrying me away ; for it is not 2
the purpose of this letter to sing Messalla’s praises‚
especially not to Brutus, who knows his merits as well
as I, and knows even better these particular accom-
plishments which I am extolling. As I was bidding
him a sorrowful good-bye‚ I had this one consolation,
that in passing over to you——to my second self, as it
were—he was performing a friendly duty and treading
the path of high distinction. But enough of this Ῑ

Ι now come, at long last, to a certain letter,<² in 3
which amid a mass of compliments you find one fault,
that I am immoderate and as it were a spendthrift in
votes of honour. That is what you say ; some one
else perhaps will say that I am too harsh in the matter
of censure and punishment—but maybe you say this
