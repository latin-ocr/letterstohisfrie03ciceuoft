EPISTULAF, AD FAMILIARFS. XIII. xv11.

The strongest tie that binds us however is one that
I may almost call a more sacred relationship—the fact
that he is a most intimate friend of my dear Atticus,
whom he respects and esteems more than anybody
else in the world.

If you happen to have made his acquaintance 2
already, Ι expect I am too late in doing what I do ; for
such 13 1113 courtesy and civility, that I expect 116 1133
already been his own recommendation to you. But
even if this be so, I earnestly beg you, that, whatever
goodwill you may have shown him before the receipt
of this letter, my recommendation, now that you have
received it, may as far as possible enhance it.

If, however, his bashfulness has prevented his 3
obtruding himself upon you, or if you are not suffi-
ciently acquainted with him, or if there be any reason
for his requiring some stronger recommendation,
well, then, I hereby recommend him to you so
emphatically that Ι could not possibly recommend
any man with greater enthusiasm or for sounder
reasons3 and Ι 311311 do what those do who submit
their recommendations conscientiously and dis-
interestedly, that is to say, I shall pledge my word to
you, or rather give you my promise and solemn under-
taking, that such is Μ’. Curius’s character, such his
integrity and his kindliness combined, that if you
make his acquaintance, you will assuredly deem him
worthy both of your friendship and of so elaborate a
recommendation. At any rate you will have done
me a great favour ifI have reason to know that this
letter has carried as much weight with you as I felt
sure it would when I wrote it.
