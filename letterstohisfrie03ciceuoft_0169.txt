EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. nvn—nvn.

And that is why Ι beg of you to order them, and the
people of Alabanda, to send ecdici to Rome.
Furthermore Philotes of Alabanda has given 2
Cluvius a mortgage, and that mortgage has lapsed.
I should be glad if you would see that he either
surrenders the mortgaged property and hands it over
to Cluvius’s agent, or else pays the money 3 and
moreover that the people of Heraclea α and Bargylia,b
who are also his debtors, should either pay him the
money owed, or else satisfy his claims by allowing him

a charge on their income.
The people of Caunusc are also in his debt but 3

they declare that they have the money lying on
deposit. Please inquire into the matter, and if you
arrive at the conclusion that they have not had the
money deposited either by edict or by decree‚⁶²'do
your best by your ruling to secure ’che interest thereon
for Cluvius. I am the more worried on account of all
this because the interests of our friend Cn. Pompeius
are at stake‚ and because he strikes me as being even
more worried than even Cluvius himself, and I am
most anxious that we should satisfy his claims. - ,Ι
earnestly beg of you again and again to attend to

these matters.
