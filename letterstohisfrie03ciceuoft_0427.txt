EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 1.

II. “ Ah Ξ but,'’ it may be objected‚ “ among these 7
very men serious disputes arise‚ numerous wrongs
spring up, and great conflicts are the result.'' As
though I supposed for a moment that you had not a
lot of trouble on your shoulders ! Ι fully understand
that your trouble is very great, and calls for the
soundest possible judgment. But remember that, in
my opinion, this trouble of yours depends far more
upon judgment than upon fortune. For what
trouble is it to control those whom you rule, if you
control yourself ? For others, Ι grant, that may be a
great and difficult thing to do, and it is indeed most
difficult ; but for you it has always been the easiest
thing in the world, and indeed was bound to be so,
since your nature is such that I think it would have
been capable of sels—restraint even without educa-
tion ; but you have had such an education as might
well ennoble the most depraved nature. While you
yourself still resist money, and pleasure, and every
form of desire, as you do resist them, there will, I
imagine,⁰ be danger of your being unable to restrain
some unscrupulous trader or some rather too rapacious
tax-collector! For as to the Greeks, lifing as you
do, they will so gaze upon you as to deem you
someone celebrated in their own annals, or even
think that a deified mortal has dropped down from
heaven into their province.

And I write thus not to make you act, but to make 8
you rejoice that you are acting, and have acted, in
this way. It is a glorious thought that you should
have been three years in Asia in supreme command,
and not been tempted by the offer of any statue,
picture, plate, garment, or slave, by any fascination
of human beauty, or any pecuniary proposals—
