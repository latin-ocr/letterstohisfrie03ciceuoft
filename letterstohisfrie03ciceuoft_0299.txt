EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XV. v.

province, in saving the kingdom and person of King
Ariobarzanes, and in winning back the hearts of our
allies to an enthusiastic acceptance of our rule.

As to the supplicatio having been decreed, if, in a 2
matter wherein the interests of the State were secui-ed
not in any degree by chance, but by your own con-
summate statesmanship and sels-restraint, you your-
self prefer that we should render thanks to the im-
mortal gods, rather than credit you with that success
——well then I am glad ofit. But ifyou imagine that 3
supplicatio is a sure earnest of a triumph, and if that
be your reason for wishing good luck to get all the
praise rather than yourself,<2 let me tell you that a
triumph does not invariably follow a supplicatio, and
that it is a much more splendid thing than any triumph
to have the deliberate declaration of the Senate that
the retention and preservation of the province was
due to the gentle rule and probity of its commander,
rather than to military force or the favour of heaven ;
and that was my conviction when I recorded my
v.ote

Now my reason for having written to you at such 3
length in defiance of my usual practice is to induce
you to believe (and I am most anxious you should)
that I am making every effort to convince you of two
facts—that I gave my support to that course which I
considered most effectively conducive to your honour,
and that at the same time I rejoice at the adoption of
the course y ou personally preferred.

Iarew ell, and maintain your esteem for me, and,
following the path upon which you h ave entered,
assure to the allies and the Republic the continuance
of your strict devotion to duty.
