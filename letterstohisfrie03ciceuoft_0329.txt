CICERO ΤΟ CASSIUS

Rome, J anuary, 45 B.c.

I expect you must be just a little ashamed of your-
self now that this is the third letter that has caught
you before you have sent me a single leaf or even a
line.‘¹ But I am not pressing you, for I shall look for·
ward to, or rather insist upon, a longer letter. As for
myself, if I always had somebody to trust with them,
I should send you as many as three an hour. For it
somehow happens, that whenever I write anything to
you, you seem to be at my very elbow ; and that, not
by way of ‘⁴ visions of images,” as your new friends ὓ
term them, who believe that even “ mental visions ’'
are conjured up by what Catius calls “ spectres ''
(for let me remind you that Catius the Insubrian, an
Epicurean, who died lately, gives the name of
“ spectres '' to what the famous Gargettian,c and
long before that Democritus, called “ images ’').

But, even supposing that the eye can be struck by
these ‘¹ spectres '' because they run up against it
quite of their own accord, how the mind can be so
struck is more than I can see. It will be your duty to
explain to me, when you arrive here safe and sound,
whether the “ spectre ’' of you is at my command to
run up against me as soon as the whim has taken me
to think about you—and not only about you, who
always occupy my inmost heart, but suppose Ι begin
thinking about the Isle of Britain, will the ‘⁴ image ''
of that wing its way to my consciousness ? α

Cicero cannot understand how this second effect is pro-

duced, or why, directly he chooses to think of Cassius, the
εἴδωλον should ⁶· run up against himss'
