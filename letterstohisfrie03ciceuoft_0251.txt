EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIV. xan-XIX.

to stay in Rome or in some place of safety with me.
That is not a question for me alone, but also for you.
What suggests itself to me is this—that, thanks to
Dolabella, you ean safely stay in Rome, and that his
kindness might be of assistance to us if violence or
lootings begin.‘² On the other hand Ι am impressed
by the evidence I have that all loyalists have left
Rome, and have their ladies with them. Now the
district in which Ι am consists not only of towns
devoted to me, but also of estates belonging to me,
so that you could be constantly with me, and, if you
went away, could be housed comfortably, and on
our own property. I have not myself quite definitely
decided which is the better course. Please observe
what other ladies of your standing are doing, and
beware lest when you want to get out of Rome, you
are not allowed to do so. I would have you seriously
consider this again and again among yourselves and
with your friends. Please tell Philotimus b to get
the house barricaded and guarded. I would also
have you establish a regular succession of letter-
carriers‚ so that I may get some sort of a letter from
you every day. But the main point is to do all you
can to keep well, if you wish me to do so. Formiae,
J an. 22nd.
