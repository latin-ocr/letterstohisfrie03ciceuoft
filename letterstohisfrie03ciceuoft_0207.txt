than usual, in the name of our friendship and your
unvarying devotion to me, to take particular pains in
the following matter also : my slave Dionysius, who
had the charge of my very costly library, having
stolen a lot of books, and thinking that he would be
punished for the thest, has absconded. He is in your
province. Both my friend Bolanus and several others
saw him at Narona,⁰ but when he declared that I had
given him his freedom, they took his word for it. If
you charge yourself with the business of getting him
back for me, I cannot tell you how delighted I shall
be. Itis a small thing in itself, but my annoyance is
great. Bolanus will inform you where he is, and
what can be done. lf you are the means of my
getting the rascal back, I shall consider that you have

done me a very great kindness.
