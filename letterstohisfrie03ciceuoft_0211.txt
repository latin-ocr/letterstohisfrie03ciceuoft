EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIII. Lxmx.

Avianius is in Sicily, Marcus is with us. I ask you to
advance the claims ofthe former, whom you have with
you, and to protect the interests of both. There is
nothing you can do in your province that would
please me better, and I earnestly beg of you again
and again to do so.
