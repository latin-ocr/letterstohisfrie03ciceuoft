EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xxm.

matters Ι want to talk over with you face to face,
and ’that at the earliest possible moment.

I did not wait for you, Brutus, to write about your 6
sister’s children. Altogether‚ the mere state of the
times (for the war will be a long one) is keeping their
case open against your return. But from the outset,
when Ι could not foretell the long duration of the
war, I pleaded the case of ’the boys in the Senate with
such force as I believe you may have been able to
ascertain from your mother's letters. Indeed there
will never be any affair in which Ι shall not, even at
'the risk of my life, speak and act in the way which
I shall judge to be in accord with your wishes and in
your interest. J uly 27.
