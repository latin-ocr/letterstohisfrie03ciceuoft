EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, I. 1.

most popular ; it was in his court, for the first time,
that the lictor made no fuss, and the beadle held his
tongue, while everyone spoke as often as he pleased,
and as long as he pleased. It is possible that by so
doing he gave one the impression of being too gentle,
were it not that this very gentleness served to
counteract such an instance of severity as the follow-
ing: certain “men of Sulla ”⁰ were compelled to
restore what they had carried off by violence and
intimidation, and those who, when in office, had
passed unjust decreeS, were themselves, when private
citizens, obliged to bow to the same rulings. This
severity on his part might seem a bitter pill to swallow,
were it not coated with the honey ofmany a kindness.

But if this gentleness is popular at Rome, where 2·

such arrogance is to be found, such unrestricted
liberty, such unbounded licence on every side, and in
short, so many magistrates, so many sources of aid,
such power in the people, such authority in the
Senate, how welcome, I ask you, must the courteous-
ness of a praetor be in Asia, where so vast a multi-
tude of citizens and allies, so many cities and comr
munities concentrate their gaze upon the nod of a
single man3 where there is no succour for the
oppressed‚ no facility for protest, no senate, no
popular assembly ? It must, therefore, ever be the
privilege of some great man, and a man not only
instinctively sels-controlled, but also refined by
learning and the study of all that is best in the arts,
so to conduct himself in the possession of so vast
a power that the absence of any other power may
never be regretted by his subjects.
