you always ar.c that you have bought 3 farm is 3

charming picture it is! I seem to see you buying
rural implementS, hobnobbing with 3our steward‚
or keeping the pips after deSseit in the corner of
3our cloak. b But 35 regards the money part of it, I
am as so·¹ cry as 3ou are 0that I w 35 not forthcoming

only fortune comes to mine3 especially 35 Ι know
that that farm of yours waS bought as our joint-
investment.

all a Greek3 for that will relieve me of 3 lot of
trouble in writing out lecture-notes.c Above all, I

we may have some literary talk together. I com-
mend Anterus ἆ to you. Farewell.
