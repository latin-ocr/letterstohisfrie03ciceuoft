EPISTULAE AD FAMILIARES, XIV. lv.

other slaves the arrangement is this : that ifmy estate
passed out of my hands they were to be my freed-
men,provided they could make good this claima ; but if
the estate still remains in my hands, that they should
continue to be my slaves, with the exception of an
extremely small number. But these are minor points.

As to your exhorting me to be of good courage and 5
not to abandon the hope of recovering my civil rightS,
I could only wish that matters were such as to justify
the hope. As it is, poor wretch, when shall I at last
get a letter from you? who will bring it me? I
should have awaited one at Brundisium, had the
sailors allowed it, but they did not want to miss the
favourable weather. For the rest, bear up, Terentia
mine, with all the dignity you can. We have lived ;
we have had our day. It was not our faih'ngs, but
our virtues, that laid us low ; I am guilty of no wrong,
except that I did not forfeit my life when I forfeited
my honours. But if our children preferred that I
should live, let us bear all else, unbearable though
it be. But there—I, who am encouraging γοα, can-
not encourage myself.

That faithful fellow, Clodius Philetaerus,⁶ I have 6
sent home, because he was incapacitated by a weak-
ness of the eyes. Sallustius ὸ takes the prize for good
service. Pescenniusb is most cordially inclined towards
me, and I hope he will always be attentive to you.
Sicca ⁰ had declared his intention of remaining with
me, but he left me at Brundisium. Take as much care
as possible to keep well, and always remember that
your misery causes me more distress than my own.
Terentia mine, the most faithful and best of wives,
and my very dear little daughter and Cicero, our last
remaining hope, good-bye. Brundisium, April 29th.
