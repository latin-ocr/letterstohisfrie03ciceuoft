EPISTULAE AD BRUTU31,x1x.

you wrote me a 1ep103 ing letter 1n terms more 563616
111311 30111 1151131 513 16 would admit.

Therefore, as I attached great value to 30111 judgc- 2
ment and fc‘n ed 3our repr,oof I pulled 1111315611ἱ
together and took the 16550115 33111611 Ι had taught
and studjed and assimilated the more to heart, when
you reinforced them with your moral weight. Yes,
and I, Brutus, was at that time under no obligation
save to the social code and the law of Nature, · but
you must now play up to the public and the stage you
hold, as the saying goes. I 01· when the gaze of your
50161615, and not onl3 of 1116111,1)111 of allU citizens and
of almost the entire 33011(1 15 centred upon 3ou, it
would be scandalous for a man who inspires the rest
of us with greater courage to exhibit in his own 6356
311 enfeebled spirit. I or ὃ11115 reason 3011 opened your
heart to 3our sorrow (for 331131 3 011 lost never had its
like on 631·,111) and under 511611 3 heavy bl ow you must
needs 5011033, 1651 your 3613 anod3ne‚ complete im-
per3·iousness to pain, should afflict you worse 111311 1116
561156 of pain; but whereas moderation in grief is
expedient in others, it is indispensable for you.

I should write more, were it not that what I kare 3
written 15 100 long, when add1 essed 10 you, W e are
waiting for 3ou and 3our army3 without it we think
336 511311 scarcely attain sufficient freedom, even
though all else should fall out as 336 11336 planned.

Ishall write more about the general politica] situation
and perhaps shall give you more certain news in the
letter which I propose to give to our friend Vetus.
