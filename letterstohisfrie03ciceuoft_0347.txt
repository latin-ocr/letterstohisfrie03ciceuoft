EPISTULAF, AD FAMILIARES, XV. xm.

place, when Ι sent that letter to Calvus‚⁰ I had no idea
that it would get abroad any more than the one you
are now reading. You see, I have one way of writing
what I think will be read by those only to whom Ι
address my letter, and another way of writing what
I think will be read by many. In the next place I
eulogized his genius in terms of higher praise than
you think could have been done with truth. To be-
gin with, it was because I really thought so 3 he was a
man of keen mental activity ὸ ; he pursued a certain
definite style, and although in that he committed an
error of judgment—-and yet judgment was his strong
point—he none the less did capture the style of his
choice. He was a man of wide and abstruse reading,
but he lacked force. That is therefore what I pressed
him to acquire. Now in rousing and stimulating a
lnan's energies there is nothing more efficacious than
to praise him while you urge him on. So there you
have my judgment of Calvus, and my object in ex-
pressing it—my object was that I praised him with a
view to encouraging him; my judgment‚ that I had
an exceedingly high opinion of his natural abilities.
It only remains sor me to speed your departure 5

with my love, to look forward to your return with
hope, to cherish your memory in your absence, and to
alleviate our mutual yearnings as long as they last by
the interchange of letters. On your part I should like
you constantly to call to mind your acts of devotion
and service to me ; and though it is open to you (it
would be a crime in me) to forget thern, you will have
reason not only to regard me as an honest man, but
also to conclude that my affection for you is of the
strongest.
