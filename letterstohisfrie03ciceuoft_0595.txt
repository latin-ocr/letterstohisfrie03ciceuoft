EPISTULAE AD QUINTUM FRATREM, 111. 1.

Also you remind me about the pleasurc-gardens;
well, Ι was never very keen on them, and, as it is,
my town house supplies me with all the amenities of
a pleasure-garden. When I arrived at Rome on
September 18, I found the roof on your house

success, and, if Ι retain a particle of independence, he
will never succeed. I await your letter with intense
eagerness.
