EPISTULAE AD BRL'TL’M, 1.

instead of being put off from da3⁷ to day, or if they
had not been held back and postponed e3· er since the3
were adopted for translation into action, we should
by now have the war off our hands.

Brutus, I have displa3 ed 1n the service of the state 2
all those qualities which should be shown b3 one who
stands as I do in senatorial rank and popular estima-
tion, and not merely those which should be demanded
in a man as a matter of course, loyalty, watchfulness,
love of country—for those are what no man may with-
hold. Now my view is that he who takes the lead in
stating an opinion on public affairs should displa3
sagacity into the bargain; and seeing that I have
taken so much upon myself as to grasp the helm of
state, I should consider m3⁷ self no less w orthy of
censure if my advice to the Senate were unpractical
than if it were disloyal.

I know that you receive full and accurate accounts 3
of past and present doings 3 but coming from me, this
is what I would have 3⁷ou understand, that I for one
am in spirit in the fighting line and am not looking f01
an3⁷ line of retreat, unless by an3 chance the interest
of the communit3s should make me change m3 front.
But most men regard 3ou and Cassius as their stand-
by. Therefme, BrutUS‚ get 3ourself to realize that
if the present campaign goes in our fa3 our, the reform
of the state will be incumbent upon you ; or else, if
we have a set-back, it will be for you to retrieve the

state.
