EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, v.-vr.

achieved. If you reject this way of thinking I shall
speak up for your view, but without abandoning
mine. Men do not look for any behaviour on your
part that is either lax or vindictive. You may easily
strike a balance in this case by dealing drastically with
the leaders and showing generosity to the troops.

I would like you, my dear Brutus, to have my son 6
Cicero at your side as much as possible. He will
never obtain a better training in the manly arts than
by studying and imitating you. April 14.

CICERO ΤΟ BRUTUS
Rome, April 17, 43 B.c.

. . . Ι am delighted to hear that you found the 3
army and the rnounted troops well disposed. If, as 4
you say, you have news of Dolabella, you will let me
know. Ι rejoice that in his case I made timely provi-
sion, so that you should be free to decide whether to
make war on Dolabella. As I perceived at the time,
my action closely touched the interests of the state ;
as I now judge matters, it touches your honour.

You remark that I took plenty of time before I 5
opened my attack on the Antonii, and you commend
me for this. VVell, Ι (10 believe that this is your point
of view. But nothing could induce me to accept that
distinction which you draw. You say that we should
display more zeal in banning civil wars than in wreak-
ing vengeance on the vanquished. Ι heartily dis·
agree with you, Brutus, and I cannot defer to your
leniency. No, a wholesome sternness carries the day
