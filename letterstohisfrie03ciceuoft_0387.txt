EPISTULAF, AD FAMILIARES, XVI. xvr-xvn,

the newsa in precisely the proper way. All of you
was revealed to nie in your letter. I have promised
Sabinus'sb serving-men to do all they asked, and

I shall do 50.

XVII
CICERO To TIRO
Astura, July 29, 45 ize.

I see what you are up to; you want your own 1
letters also to be put into book form. But look rou
here, sir, you who love to be the “rule ’' ⁶ offmys
writings, where did you get such a solecism as “faith-
fully ministering to your health ''? How comes
fideliter ἆ to be used in such a connexion ? That word’s
proper home is in the province of duty, though its
migrations to foreign territory are frequent—for in-
stance, learning, a house, art, or even a field, can all
be called “faitlffzcl‚’' provided, as Theophrastus holds,
that its metaphorical application is not shockingly
extravagant. But of this when we meet.

Demetrius‘3 came to see me, but I was elever
enough to extricate myself from that companion-
ship. You evidently could not have seen him. He
will be in Rome ’to-morrow‚ so you will see him then.
My own intention is not to leave this place till the
morning after next.

Your health is a great anxiety to me ς but go on

of “ thoroughly ” οι· “ conscientiously '’ is proved by Ovid‘s
‘⁶ inqenuas didicisse fidel iter artes Emollit mores,''

⁶ Perhaps this is Demetrius of Sadara, a favourite freed-
man of Pompey's. Tyrrell.
