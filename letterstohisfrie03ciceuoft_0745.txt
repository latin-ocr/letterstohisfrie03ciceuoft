EPISTULAE AD BRUTUM, xxw.

sight of all. Ι suspect that you did not altogether
approve what was disapproved by your intimates
(excellent men, I admit, but unversed in pohtics),
that I carried a resolution conferring upon Caesar the
right of a J oyous Entry.‘² For myself-—but perhaps I
am at fault, only I am not the man to take the
highest pleasure in my own achievements—I do not
think that in this war I ever had a sounder idea ; the
reason for this I must not disclose, lest I should
make an impression of foresight rather than of grati-
tude.—I arn labouring this point too much3 so let
us turn to something else. I had honours conferred
upon D. Brutus and upon L. Plancus. Theirs are
indeed noble natures that heed the call of glory ; but
the Senate too shows discretion, in that it offers
whatever inducement (consistent with honour) it
thinks will serve in each particular case to win a man
to the service of the state. But you take me to task
about Lepidus : we first set up a statue in his
honour οΠ the Speakers' Platform, then we cast it
down. We made an effort to recall him from his
madness by honouring him. The infatuation of that
fluffiest of fellows proved too strong for our precau-
tions; even so, less harm was done in setting up
Lepidus' statue than good in casting it down.
Enough has been said about honours. Now I must 10

make a few remarks about punishment ; for I have
often discerned from your letters that you wish to
be given credit for leniency in regard to those whom
you have overmastered in war. I consider indeed
that your wisdom is unfailing; yet I believe that
to remit punishment for crime (for that is what
“ pardoning '’ amounts to), however passable it may
be on another occasion, is utterly ruinous in this war.
